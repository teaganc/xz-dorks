      "message": "A small point release, mainly for fixes and bugs, plus a few minor matching\ntable updates. Also some core tools updates, which make supporting gpu devices\neasier over time, particularly nvidia ones. Also some gpu data updates, new\nnvidia 545, which was unexpected, came out, extending the time to next legacy by\nsome months.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSPECIAL THANKS:\n\n1. GRAPHICS: GPU DATA: codeberg user malcolmlewis who also posted both the first\npinxi issue, and the first codeberg issue. I had not thought nvidia would forget\nto add their own device IDs to their lists, but they did. This prompted an\nupgrade to the gpu_raw.pl/gpu_ids.pl to better handle manual add files for\nNvidia, as well as better overall consistency for gpu data files and processing.\n\n2. SYSTEM: Wakeups: Mint user senjoz for alerting me to the well done but\nunfortunately localized to mint forums report on the wrong wakeup count report,\nbecause the data source was not what I thought it was.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKNOWN ISSUES:\n\n1. Any distro forum person who finds issues related to inxi maybe being wrong or\noperating from false assumptions in terms of data sources should ideally find a\nway to report these issues directly, either via a codeberg issue, an email, or\nsomething else. It's not possible or practical to track every forum that uses\ninxi to debug user issues, so if members of those forums can be more proactive\nin terms of sending what appear to be valid issue reports to the inxi project,\nthat will help a lot.\n\n2. GRAPHICS: GPU: no data for things like Biren and other non AMD/Intel/Nvidia\nGPUs. If you are into GPUs, by all means, help us out here!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBUGS:\n\n1. INFO: main::get_wakeups(): I'd say that despite in the past largely being\ncorrect, using /sys/power/wakeup_count is a bug, but a bug that is excusable\nbecause the docs are just too opaque about what this thing actually refers to.\nMy assumption re its meaning was clearly wrong.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFIXES:\n\n1. INFO: main::get_wakeups(): Issue reported via a Mint forum posting which I\nwas alerted to.\n\nhttps://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?p=2378107#p2378107\n\nThis would have made it into inxi 3.3.30 easily since the patch is changing file\nname, but I unfortunetly did not become aware of it until right after the\nrelease, On my system, for example, with systemctl suspend instead of the not\nworking xfce suspend from gui, I get 7 wakeup_count type events counted for each\nsuspend event. On another system I have, almost same everything, except fully\nfunctioning xfce suspend feature, the success and wakeup_counts are matched.\n\nI found a value of 49000+ digging through my datasets, and I can find no\npattern, nor can I find this clearly documented, so the behavior is simply going\nto be use the value, including 0, from /sys/power/suspend_stats/success and\nusing it if it is defined, and getting rid of /sys/power/wakeup_count completely\nas a data source, which I am now no longer sure at all about the meaning of. 1\nof my systems has 7 events per resume, one, almost the same setup, has 1.\n\n2. GRAPHICS: GPU DATA: Many nvidia fixes, device ID lists updated and corrected.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nENHANCEMENTS:\n\n1a. PARTITIONS: added puzzlefs, atomfs to excludes. It's unclear, but both sound\nlike they are like isofs or something like that.\n\n2a. GRAPHICS: GPU DATA: added Nvidia Pascal, Hopper, Lovelace device IDs. See\nCode 1 for fixes to detections. Added AMD, Intel newer GPU IDs, going with Code\n1 and GPU data fixes.\n\n2b. GRAPHICS: GPU DATA: updated lists, added Nvidia current EOL data, added\nnewer kernel/X.org last supported. Added two more memssage types for current,\nlegacy messages. Found a site that lists EOL for the drivers, that helps.\n\n2c. GRAPHCIS: GPU_DATA: added new 545 driver IDs, updated nv current to 545\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCHANGES:\n\n1. DATA: pinxi/tools/lists: made file names consistent for gpu data types.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDOCUMENTATION:\n\n1. DOCS: docs/inxi-graphics.txt, docs/inxi-partitions.txt - ongoing updates for\nfeatures. More GPU data added, new file system types.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCODE:\n\n1a. GRAPHICS: GPU DATA: pinxi/tools/gpu_raw.pl, pinxi/tools/gpu_ids.pl. Upgraded\nto enable basic manual additions to nvidia drivers. Also fixed detections for\nHopper and Lovelace, those were too tight and I missed some device IDs there.\n\nRedid tools/gpu_raw.pl and gpu_ids.pl to have the more predictable file names.\n\nAlso changed the file names to be consistent for nv data in pinxi/tools/lists/\n  gpu.[amd|intel].full\n  gpu.[amd|intel].full.sorted\n  gpu.[amd|intel].manual\n  gpu.amd.github\n  gpu.intel.com\n  gpu.nv.[driver].full\n  gpu.nv.[driver].full.sorted\n  gpu.nv.[driver].manual\n  gpu.nv.[driver].raw\n\nThis let me bring all the lists up to date, and some manual fixes added in to\nsome driver sets.\n\n1b. GRAPHICS: GPU_DATA: pinxi/tools/gpu_ids.pl - updated for Nvidia: new\nmessages, current eol, filled out legacy drivers with their eol based on last\nnvidia driver release date.\n\n2. CORE: there were some pointless globals being used, as part of the overall\neffort to get rid of globals where sensible, else move them into hashes/arrays,\nmakes code easier to maintain long term.",

      "message": "PACKAGERS! inxi repos are moved to https://codeberg.org/smxi/inxi\n\nThe repos will mirror to github for a short amount of time, until after 3.3.30\nis released, then I am probably going to do some big changes in the structure of\nthe inxi repo. Make sure to update your packaging tools and scripts for this\nchange.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, a huge upgrade for Wayland future proofing, and other futures that are\nmaybe coming, by adding EGL API, and Vulkan for good measure. This should handle\nwayland finally, that's been a stub forever, but finally realized eglinfo was a\nthing, and that vulkan as well could be a contender to replace OpenGL, at least\nthat's what Mesa says on their site, and they should know.\n\nThis handles one of the longest standing weak points of inxi graphics, being\ncompletely X11-centric, even though wayland support exists fairly extensively,\nbut this glxinfo dependent feature was a niggling annoyance, now it's fairly\nambivalent about which api tool you throw at it, the hardest is to give the\nright message for no data, or incomplete data. Note that eglinfo supplies at\nleast software rendering out of X11 or Wayland, so we can now get some API data\nin console, including if supported, OpenGL data. Not all of it, but some of it.\n\nAlso since now all the docs are split and granular, with the Graphics API\nupgrades, added data sample files from glxinfo, eglinfo, vulkaninfo, and vainfo\nfor good measure, just to have some of the latter. This is one of the first time\nall the data used to develope a feature, docs for that feature, and the feature\nitself, are being shared and released at the same time.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSPECIAL THANKS:\n\n1a. GRAPHICS: API: Arch user Chrome30 on github for requesting vulkan data, and\nproviding the initial datasamples that made it possible to think about this new\nAPI feature.\n\n1b. CheckRecommends: Display packages: mrmazda, a frequent helper, checked and\nupdated OpenSUSE and Fedora vulkan/egl/glx API tool package names. Those have\nbeen a bit fluid and many of the names I had were not right.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKNOWN ISSUES:\n\n1a. GRAPHICS: nothing is perfect, for sudo/root the detections fail for OpenGL\nAPI messages, but fallbacks will make it a bit nicer than it was, with some\ndata, instead of none as before.\n\n1b. GRAPHICS: API: I'm assuming that the greatest EGL version number found is\nthe actual version, and lower versions are what that platform supports. This is\nan assumption, not a known fact, but finding this stuff clearly documented tends\ntowards near impossibility, or takes forever to determine, so that's the\nassumption that is being used. Correct via issue and clear explanation with\nlinks to resources if this is incorrect.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBUGS:\n\n1. Nothing to speak of.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFIXES:\n\n1. PARTITIONS: had wekafs as a zfs type fs, it's not, it's more like NAS, cloud.\nAdded to distributed list, and removed from zfs|btrfs|hammer list. I know, I\nknow, will it ever matter? Probably not. But just in case, wouldn't want your\nlocal machine to report with petabytes of storage now would we!\n\n2. CheckRecommends: corrected some Fedora, SUSE package names.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nENHANCEMENTS:\n\n1a. SYSTEM: DistroData: added Bodhi id method, /etc/bodhi/info file which is\nsimilar to /etc/lsb_release, updated system base detection as well. System base\ncomes from /etc/os-release.\n\n1b. SYSTEM: DistroData: Added Nitrux system base (debian). Why they try hide\nthis is beyond me. Maybe because they are not using a real PM, and don't include\napt, who knows.\n\n2a. GRAPHICS: new nvidia gpu ids.\n\n2b. Graphics: EGL API data:\n* Shows eglinfo missing if appropriate, no data messages if appropriate.\n* -G shows EGL version(s), drivers, active platforms.\n* -Gx adds active/inactive platforms as sub items of platforms.\n* -Gxx shows platforms by platform, with egl version, driver. EGL version only\nshows if there were more than 1 detected, otherwise it shows with EGL v:\n* -Gxxx shows hw based on driver, if found, like vulkan.\n\nTo avoid excess verbosity, does not show renderer OpenGL name per platform\nbecause it would be way too long and repetetive. And besides, that would show\nin OpenGL anyway, more or less, unless there are two different GPUs, which is a\ncase that is not fully handled.\n\n2c. GRAPHICS: OpenGL data:\n* If glxinfo not present, or with null output due to root/no display, and if\neglinfo available, and has OpenGL items, will populate most of OpenGL API with\ndata, except for Direct Rendering and GLX version. Shows appropriate messages\nindicating it's EGL sourced for console, root, no data, or glxinfo missing.\n* -Gx adds GLX version, if detected.\n* -Gxx add: ES version, if detected; device-ID, if available. Also adds\ndisplay-ID, if Display-ID was not found in the Display line (which probably\nmeans that xdpyinfo or xrandr were not installed). Does not always show since it\nalready appeared in Display line if it was discovered.\n* -Ga adds device memory, and unified memory status (yes/no).\n\n2d. GRAPHICS: Vulkan API data:\n* Shows appropriate messages if vulkaninfo present, but no data found.\n* -G shows Vulkan version, drivers, and surfaces.\n* -Gx device counts.\n* -Gxx adds device by id, type, driver report.\n* -Gxxx adds layer count; adds device hardware vendor, based on mesa driver. Not\nfor nvidia driver, since that is self evident. Goes away with -Ga if device name\nexists.\n* -Ga adds full device report, including per device names, ids, drivers, driver\nversions, surfaces.\n\n3. UPDATE: Because the smxi.org server no longer accepts TSL 1.1 based HTTP\nrequests, added for extreme legacy systems a new update option, -U 4, which\nuses direct FTP download from smxi.org ftp server. If system set to default to\nperl downloader HTTP::Tiny it switches to using a non perl downloader\nautomatically, like wget or curl.\n\n4. CPU: Microarch: got early zen5 possible IDs. Both Intel/AMD may have rough\nID working well before they ship in public. CPU stuff has slowed down a lot,\nthe 4,3n nodes are not easy, obviously.\n\n5. DRIVES: Many more drive vendors and drive IDs.\n\n6. RAM: More RAM vendors. Note that it's not unusual for a Drive vendor to also\nmake RAM, and vice versa.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCHANGES:\n\n1a. GRAPHICS: For API, show OpenGL mesa-v: x.x.x separate from main API v:\nstring. Also only shows the actual API version with v: now, like v: 4.5. Also\nshows vendor: nvidia v: 340.23 for nvidia, without mesa. Falls back for\nunhandled cases or syntaxes to the whole version string for v:.\n\n1b. GRAPHICS: For OpenGL, shows compat-v: always if present, that was a mistake\nnot to show it unless -Gx, since otherwise you'd think you are running a\ndifferent version. Not a common situation, but on legacy hardware, can happen.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDOCUMENTATION:\n\n1a. DOCS: docs/inxi-cpu.txt - reorganized into more coherent sections, like with\nlike, etc. Added better top Sections navigation since there is so much data.\n\n1b. DOCS: docs/inxi-resources.txt - moved last code tricks to\ndocs/tips-tricks.txt.\n\n1c. DOCS: new docs/ files inxi-battery.txt, inxi-debuggers.txt,\ninxi-devices.txt, inxi-kernel.txt, inxi-machine.txt, inxi-network.txt,\ninxi-raid-logical.txt, inxi-start-client.txt, inxi-tty.txt, inxi-weather.\n\nThese new files cleaned out docs/inxi-data.txt and docs/inxi-resources.txt,\nwhich are now merely placeholder files, and have no data in them beyond pointers\nto the actual data files.\n\n1d. DOCS: docs/inxi-custom-recommends.txt updated for SUSE/Fedora packag name\nfixes and new eglinfo and vulkaninfo items.\n\n2a. DATA: moved more data from non public data to shared. Refactored directories\nto be better organized, and to follow the overall inxi data structures better.\n\n2b. DATA: added many more eglinfo, glxinfo, vulkaninfo to data/graphics. Also\nadded some clinfo, vainfo just in case decide to support those APIs.\n\n3a. MAN/OPTIONS: updated for new graphics API features, new verbsity features,\netc.\n\n3b. MAN/OPTIONS: added -U arguments for man, for some reason I'd left those out.\nAlso removed options references to -U 1, 2, because those should never be used,\nif those versions of inxi even exist, they are ancient. Added -U 4 option, and\nexplanation of when/why to use it.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCODE:\n\n1a. FAKE DATA: updated paths for fake data to reflect data reorganization.\n\n1b. FAKE DATA: Added --fake egl,glx,vulkan for GRAPHICS API.\n\n2. GRAPHICS: Fully refactored opengl_output, moved to gl_data/opengl_output.\nAdded egl_data, egl_output, and vulkan_data, vulkan_output, and some other\ntools.\n\n3. UPDATE: if downloader is set to 'perl', aka, Tiny::HTTP, and -U 4 is used,\nwhich is a direct FTP download of the inxi/pinxi files, tiny is disabled, and\nthe next available downloader (wget/curl/fetch) is used instead.\n\n4. DEBUGGER: added clinfo, eglinfo, es2_info, vainfo, vdpauinfo, vulkaninfo.",

      "message": "Some significant bugs, 1 showstopper for FreeBSD, and one universal one for USB\nnetwork devices, and possibly some other USB device types. Also some nice new\nfeatures.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSPECIAL THANKS:\n\n1. SYSTEM: Github user chromer030 in issue #285 - a very nice small enhancement\nto -Sxxx line, adding kernel clocksource, and with -Sa, adding available\nclocksources. I wish all issues were this clean and easy to implemment, with\nsuch clear benefit.\n\n2. BLUETOOTH: Github user chromer030, issue #286 - extending and adding\nbluetooth report feature. This required refactors and some cleanup of bad logic\nto make -E more able to handle new data sources, and also made me fix the docs\nand add debugger data files to make testing changes for various bluetooth\ndatasources easier. Adding btmgmt turned out to have a lot of long term benefits\nto the bluetooth feature and internal inxi logic, I hadn't realized how hacked\non bluetooth feature was, but code review showed it clearly.\n\n3. SYSTEM: Github user oleg-indeez found a break in FreeBSD compiler data, 2\nglitches, one made inxi crash due to is array test on undefined reference, the\nother maybe a bad copy paste in the past that assigned compiler data to wrong\nhash. See CODE 3 for details on the ref issue.\n\n4. SWAP: Github user chromer030, again, issue #290 suggested some swap\nzram/zswap data enhancements, seems good, so thanks.\n\n5. UsbData: Slackware/Linuxquestions.org poster J_W for posting on a device\nmissing in his output as of 3.3.27 inxi. This exposed bug 3, which usually was\nnpt visible since the fallback was catching most of the network matches, but\nsince he had a TP-Link, and it went missing, it triggered the issues, and also\nexposed the inconsistent upper/lower case use in device type from kernel.\n\n6. NETWORK: Slackware user babydr on linuxquestions.org tripped a bug in\nnetwork, was not counting correctly to limit IP list. Led to showing limit\nmessage on 10th row of network report, not 10th IP of a device. See Bug 4.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKNOWN ISSUES:\n\n1. Nothing new.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBUGS:\n\n1. BLUETOOTH: with hciconfig, would show wrong LMP/HCI version because either\nthe syntax changed for those strings, or it was wrong always. I think it changed\nbecause this worked correctly at one point. Should now show the right hci/lmp\nversions, and the bluetooth version as expected for hcicconfig/btmgmt.\n\n2. SYSTEM: CPU compiler broke for FreeBSD 13.2, caused by bad test for undefined\narray in CompilerVersion::version_bsd(), and also, assigned kernel compiler data\nto %dboot instead of %sysctl hash. Thanks oleg-indeez for spotting that one and\nfiguring it out.\n\n3a. UsbData: Failure to use /i caseinsensitive on regex led to failure to detect\nUSB type using standard defaults, but then a further regex error, subtle, missed\na | between two elements of a pattern, led to the last fallback case for network\ndetection failing. This was coupled with a change in the Kernel, which now uses\nUppercase first sometimes, and sometimes lowercase first. I think that's a\nchange anyway. This resulted in some usb type hashes failing to load specific\ndevices, network in this case, TP-Link, which was the fallback pattern that\nbroke.\n\n3b. UsbData::assign_usb_type() improper nesting of tests led to failures that\nshould not have happened, like a bluetooth device cascading down to network.\n\n4. NETWORK: IP limit was limiting based on total row count, not the actual count\nof IPs for that device. Not sure how that slipped up. Now correctly limits the\nIPs, not the previous total rows in Network report. Thanks babydr / Slackware\nforums for finding yet more issues.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFIXES:\n\n1a. BLUETOOTH: added in switches for fake bluetooth data for all bluetooth data\nsources.\n\n1b. BLUETOOTH: made --bt-tool load $force{[tool]} to be consistent with rest of\nlogic in inxi for forcing use of specific tools. No idea why I made a standalone\none only for Bluetooth.\n\n1c. BLUETOOTH: the HCI/LMP version generators were mixing up bluetooth version\nstring and LMP, leading to wrong results. See BUGS 1. I think this was a syntax\nchange because I would not have generated this originally if the syntax had not\nworked, at least I don't think I would have. See also DOCS DATA item, added in\nsamples for dev purposes to avoid this type of issue in future.\n\n2. UsbData: Device type from /sys could be upper/lower case first, but inxi was\nnot testing for anything but lower case, which would lead to fallback tests for\nBluetooth, Network, at least, maybe others. This goes with BUG 3, which exposed\na small torrent of such potential failure cases. The fallback block of regex is\nreally only designed to catch the few that don't get caught by the generic type\ntests.\n\n3. NETWORK: UsbData::set_network_regex(). Bad regex caused bluetooth device:\n\"Intel Bluetooth wireless interface\" to trip an overly loose regex for wireless.\nSee BUG 3b. The real issue was incorrect test nesting which led to a bluetooth\ndevice falling down to network regex, which it should not have done. It also\nfailed test the product name for bluetooth, which led to failure as well.\n\n4. SWAP: Was failing to capture some zram syntaxes, regex was too tight. Failed:\n/run/initramfs/dev/zram0.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nENHANCEMENTS:\n\n1. SYSTEM: added kernel current clocksource for -Sxxx, and alternates for -Sa.\n\n2. BLUETOOTH: added btmgmt as first fallback to hciconfig, that one also\nsupplies bt version via lmp version, like hciconfig. Note this tool has very\nlittle useful information.\n\n3. Added back in discoverable, active discovery, and pairing status with -Ea.\nThis data is also crudely available from btmgmt but I would not bet on those\nitems actually being right. I'm not totally convinced that's good data, so\nmaking it admin for now. Put these in a 'status:' parent container.\n\n4a. SWAP: Added zswap enabled, compressor, max_pool_percent for -ja swap general\nfeatures line. If no zswap data and Linux, shows 'N/A'.\nhttps://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/zswap.txt\n\n4b. SWAP: Added zram comp_algorithm max_comp_streams to -j per line report, only\nfor zram, of course.\nhttps://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/blockdev/zram.html\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCHANGES:\n\n1. None that are obvious.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDOCUMENTATION:\n\n1. DATA: Added new data/bluetooth/, with several sample 'btmgmt info' and\n'hciconfig -a' outputs for debugging and reference purposes. These work with\nthe revised debuggers and force/fake data switches for bluetooth. Should add\nsome bt-adapter --info samples too to make testing/debugging easier.\n\n2a. DOCS: Made new docs/inxi-bluetooth.txt doc.\n\n2b. DOCS: Moved more data out of inxi-data.txt and inxi-resources.txt, into\ninxi-bluetooth.txt, tips-tricks.txt, man-pages.txt. While I'm not going to do it\nall at once, I am trying to move relevant data into granular doc file as I hit\nthat during dev.\n\n2c. DOCS: Updated and organized docs/inxi-tools-mapping.txt more, new mapping\ntools added. inxi has so many manually updated mapping tools that it's going to\nget more and more important that this document is accurate, and is updated when\nrequired.\n\n3a. MAN/OPTIONS: Added BT tools to --force lists, and updated --bt-tool list.\nAlso added -Ea options, the status: stuff.\n\n3b. MAN/OPTIONS: Made consistent, lower case rpm, both PM type rpm and rpm as\nrotation were switching between RPM and rpm randomly.\n\n3b. MAN/OPTIONS: Updated for --force ip/ifconfig, --ifconfig.\n\n3c. MAN/OPTIONS: Updated for zswap, zram extra -ja data.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCODE:\n\n1. BLUETOOTH: added %force bluetoothctrl, bt-adapter, btmgmt, hciconfig, rfkill,\nand added checks to enable $fake{'bluetooth'} in the main callers for each type.\nThis makes debugging and development a lot easier. Also removed the force tool\nblock in CheckTools, no idea, again, why I did it that way only for bluetooth.\n\n2. CheckTools: got rid of set_forced_tools(), which was only used for bluetooth\ntools, and didn't fit with the rest of the core logic.\n\n3. SYSTEM: CompilerVersion: used array refs wrong, or rather, used refs wrong,\nwhich led to various errors that were confusing. Corrected to start out with an\narray ref, then to pass that as is, leaving it the same ref all through, for bsd\nand linux. This is the method inxi should have always used for passing array/\nhash refs around, create as ref, then pass around, and update, without assigning\na new ref to it.\n\nI had failed to verify that the same ref was being used through the sequence.\nUnfortunately this error is probably very widespread in inxi, because no\nconsistent rule was created and enforced from the first lines of Perl.\n\n4. UsbData: added source type to --dbg 6 output, and added --dbg 55 to output\nthe per type arrays.\n\n5. NETWORK: IpData:: added --ifconfig/--force [ip|ifconfig], --fake ip-if to\nallow for basic debugging for -n / -i IP data sources. Not super useful since so\nmuch comes from /sys, but there was nothing there at all, which is weird for\nnetworking.\n\n6. SWAP: Changed to passing data using scalar references, not returning an\narray of the items, and got rid of the copies in the swap_data_advanced() tool.\nIt's less readable, but incurs basically very little overhead, and with the new\nfunction / method arg lists I'm using more now, it's clear what the references\nare.\n\n7. IpData: got rid of extra array copies for push, pointless.",

      "message": "New version, new man. Continuing the Memory info rollout started in 3.3.27.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSPECIAL THANKS:\n\n1. Thanks to linuxquestions.org Slackware forums for poking around a bit at the\nnew Memory total logic.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKNOWN ISSUES:\n\n1a. MEMORY: The memory total: has to be synthesized in some cases, based on some\nmath and educated guessing. When these guesses fall outside of predetermined\nranges, inxi will show note: est. to let the user know the total was synthesized\nand possibly incorrect. For detected virtual machines, inxi does not try to\nsynthesize the total because a VM can have any amount of RAM assigned.\n\nIf superuser, and -m used, shows the real total from dmidecode if any RAM was\nfound. Not all systems have DMI RAM data however, or have dmidecode installed.\nWill fallback to sythetic method in that case, which is usually right.\n\n1b. MEMORY: With the superuser /proc/iomem method, if on a VM and not using even\nGiB sized RAM ollocation, and -M is not triggered (which usually lets inxi know\nit's a VM), the total will get rounded up or down based on a set of rules. For\nexample, 2.5 GiB real would become 3 GiB. I don't see any solution to this,\neither assume the /proc/iomem is right but needs rounding up, or assume the /sys\nblock counts are right, or remove the feature.\n\nShows note: est. in cases where the rounded total is greater than a dynamic\nfactor difference from the internal total amount.\n\n2. GENERAL/GRAPHICS: The problem of users showing up, requesting a feature, then\nnot doing any work, research, supplying energy, interest, and dare I say,\npassion - nothing, expecting 'someone else' to do the work for them, continues,\nsadly, with the recent request for vulkan data for Graphics. This appears to be\na problem more with the modern generation of free software users, I don't\nremember this type of attitude 20 years ago, but I did watch it as it started\ngetting more common. Demotivating to be honest, but maybe one day someone will\nshow up who actually cares enough to help get the features they want developed.\n\nWhile I am leaving that up as a low priority feature request, I am not\npersonally interested in that feature, nor is anyone else I asked, and given how\nmuch raw data there is, and how difficult it is to parse, I'll just leave it as\nan existing issue which might get work in a few years time, or not, basically\nwill require someone showing up who actually actively cares.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBUGS:\n\n1. DISK: total: used: report could have had wrong results for used:, like used\nbeing > total: because the filter lists were missing some file systems for\nexclusion. More of a fix than a bug, but users might see it as a bug.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFIXES:\n\n1. INFO: get_gcc_data(): was showing same GCC version as main and alternate.\nFailed to filter out the discovered primary, that is. This is because usually\nname is gcc-11 but sometimes it's the whole version, like gcc-11.2.0, the full\nversion string. This is the case in Slackware for example.\n\n2. SHORT: MEMORY: BSD: did not show '%' for memory used percent, just the\nnumber.\n\n3. DRIVES/PARTITIONS: PartitionItem::set_filters() added many more exclude\ntypes, that will help avoid both creating wrong disk used totals, and also not\nshow label:/uuid: fields for filesystem types that don't have uuid/labels. There\nwere a lot missing: encrypted, distributed, stackable, remote. Should clean up\nwrong disk used values in some cases.\n\n4a. PARTITIONS: PartitionItem::set_filters(). Added a lot of file systems, many\nfuse, distributed, stackable types.\n\n4b. PARTITIONS: Extended remote file system ID by fs, and added fuse fs for\nlocal mounts, like gvfs, mtp, ptp and many other variants, that's things like\nmounting apple partition, android, iphone, archives, etc. This should correct an\nentire class of source: ERR-102 outputs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nENHANCEMENTS:\n\n1. BATTERY: Added 'power' to battery report. That's the amount of watts its\nusing at that moment, so not super useful since it's running inxi at that\nmoment. But the data was there, so might as well show it. Only for -Bxx since it\nwill be so variable. Shows after the charge/condition item.\n\n2. SYSTEM: DistroData: added Oracle id and system base. Added Springdale/PUIAS\nsystem base support. Note, unusually, Eurolinux, ScientificLinux 'just worked'\nre id and system base even though that had never been explicitly added. This is\nbecause their os-release file contains 'centos' string.\n\n3. SYSTEM: DistroData: Added ubuntu mantic minotaur to ubuntu id matching table.\nThis only really is used by Mint, but there you have it. Also added Debian 14\ncodename Forky.\n\n4a. MEMORY: Add total RAM from one of following:\n\n* /sys/devices/system/memory (if it's available). This directory has to be\ncompiled into kernel, so is not always present. This source has advantage of\nbeing user readable. If out of set bounds, shows note: est. to let user know\nit's an estimate.\n\n* If superuser and /proc/iomme, gets the total from /proc/iomem using some\ntricks and synthetic methods, which in general is pretty accurate, but when out\nof the bounds set, shows note: est. to let user know results are only estimates.\nThis overrides /sys total.\n\n* If -m and dmidecode data found, uses the real RAM module total. For Linux and\nsuperuser. This overrides iomem and /sys totals.\n\n4b. MEMORY: add iGPU RAM from /proc/iomem when detected. Requires sudo/root.\n\n4c. MEMORY: using the real -m/RAM total for memory total when available, since\nthat is the actual value we want, not the estimated stuff from /proc/iomem or\n/sys/devices/system.\n\n5. RAM: added a long time oversight, lack of per array RAM installed size and\noccupied slots (modules). Those are now part of the Array line for each set of\nmodules. Since total already shows in System RAM line above, the granular per\narray installed size total only shows if > 1 array is present, ie, almost never.\n\n6. DRIVES: disk vendors, added more matches and vendors. We'll know the world is\nchanging in a significant way when no new vendors appear for a while, but that's\nunlikely in the near term.\n\n7. CPU: cpu_arch(), a few new ids added.\n\n8. GRAPHICS: new amd, intel, nvidia ids, updates to driver version etc.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCHANGES:\n\n1. SHORT: for Memory:, switched to using MiB/GiB/TiB, these numbers are just\ngetting too big to be readable. This is also dynamic, if both used and available\nare the same unit, shows x/y [unit], otherwise shows x [unit]/y [unit].\n\n2. MEMORY: changed gpu: to igpu: to avoid confusing it with standalone gpu.\nSince only raspberry pi had gpu ram data before, almost nobody would have seen\nthis in general anyway.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDOCUMENTATION:\n\n1. MAN/OPTIONS: Updated for -Bxx, battery power now.\n\n2. MAN: updated to better define where the System RAM: total:.. available etc\ncome from, and what they refer to. Also added explanation in -m section about\nwhat the stuff is, and what the field names refer to.\n\n2a. DOCS: docs/inxi-ram.txt added, and more info moved from inxi-data.txt and\ninxi-resources.txt. Goal is to remove both those files and move all their data,\nand any new data, into granular inxi-xxx.txt files. Also moved some RAM data\nfrom inx-unit-handling.txt to inxi-ram.txt.\n\n2b. DOCS: docs/inxi-unit-handling.txt: updated with more ram / memory units,\ncode, etc, to better fit with the concept of the inxi-unit-handling.txt doc.\n\n2c. DOCS: docs/inxi-partitions.txt: updated, added more sources for partition\nfile system types, cleaned up, more useful as a reference now.\n\n2d. DOCS: docs/inxi-distros.txt: NEW, merged data from inxi-data.txt,\ninxi-resources.txt. Updated and added more info.\n\n2e. DOCS: docs/inxi-tools-mapping.txt split off from inxi-tools.txt, makes it\neasier to find the mapping functions and features, which are hard to remember.\nAlso updated and improved its usability. This is kind of a key document because\nit's hard to remember all the mapping tools internally, and this also connects\nthose tools to their relevant granular inxi-xxx.txt docs. Not that it will help\nget helpers for these tedious tasks, but one can always dream, can't one?\n\n3. DATA: data/graphics/ added for first vulkaninfo output file.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCODE:\n\n1a. RAM: Fixed an irregularity, for RamItem, it used MiB as internal unit, this\nwas silly because inxi uses KiB everywhere else. This correction was relatively\neasy to do, and allows the values to be used by other parts of inxi, like\nMemoryData.\n\n1b. RAM: Added return of ram total for memory.\n\n2a. INFO/RAM/PROCESSES: When MEMORY active, now uses row reference to create the\nfields. For INFO, now uses MemoryData::row() to generate the row fields instead\nof doing the logic in the info line generator. This simplifies the processing\nand allows for more granular control of output.\n\n2b. INFO/RAM/PROCESSES: Added debugger switches --dbg 53 (show raw KiB/count\nvalues for /sys/devices/system/memory and /proc/iomem. Added --dbg 54, which\nshows per line size for iomem, in human readable units, and a final summary\nreport of iomem and /sys data, this speeds up debugging.\n\n2c. INFO/RAM/PROCESSES: Added --fake iomem, --fake sys-mem for debugging and\ntesting.\n\n3. MEMORY: MemoryData::short_data(): added so one tool generates output for all\nsources for short data. Easier to track and make consistent, and to make more\ngranular and robust.\n\n4. DRIVES/PARTITIONS: PartitionItem::partition_filters(),\nPartitionItem::fs_excludes(): refactored into PartitionItem::get_filters(),\nPartitionItem::set_filters(). Cleaned up, organized better, made comments much\nmore useful. Goes with DOCS 2c updates. Now there's just one sub that does this\nfilter/exclude work, which makes it easier to maintain long term.\n\n5. GLOBAL: Used a trick I just learned, declaring variables in the bracket scope\nof a class, but not inside the package/class declaration. This makes it work\nlike a static variable, which Perl 5.008 doesn't support. You have to use a sub\ninside the bracket scope to return the data outside that scope, but that is easy\nto do.\n\n6. MACHINE: Added return of b_vm for VM detection in MEMORY.\n\n7. SYSTEM: CompilerVersion: Failed to properly use references when passing\n$compiler around, not actually sure why it worked, but now is consistent.",

      "message": "Completion of the audio fixes and improvements of 3.3.26. Added less common\nsound servers like EsounD and aRts, and made state reports more accurate for\nALSA.\n\nMajor USB code and data upgrades/refactors. The USB changes prepare inxi for USB\n4, and adds lanes and Si/IEC speeds to the report. It is important to determine\nwhat USB mode you are running in with 3.x and 4. These changes conform more\nclosely to how the USB consortium wants USB speeds refered to.\n\nWith more robust USB data, this data now appears in a similar form as pcie: data\nfor Devices, -A, -E, -G, -N, and for -D drives, as usb: plus rev, speed, lanes,\nmode, with the -xx/-a options, like pcie. This has been a long standing\noversight and weakness of inxi USB and Device data, but now the two are fully\nintegrated, including for drives, which was quite tricky to get working.\n\nAdded netpkg and Zenwalk support to packages and repos. Also added repos support\nfor sbopkg and slpkg, and updated package tools for Slackware.\n\nAnd more distros added to system base feature, and a few more for main ID.\n\nImproved --recommends report quite a bit, now it's more granular for missing\npackages and package manager reports, and also fixed a long standing missing\ncurrent shell + version issue. Added the final package manager type, pkgtool\n(Slackware), that will be supported, which makes for 4, which is enough. Note\nthat other package managers can be added following the documentation\ninstructions for packagers, but this is enough for out of the box pm handling.\n\nFixed a long standing oddity with how free / /proc/meminfo report MemTotal vs\nthe actual physical RAM. I believe this issue also showed with GPU assigned RAM,\nbut now for all but short form, shows Memory/RAM: available: ... used: ...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSPECIAL THANKS:\n\n1. To the Slackware people at linuxquestions.org forums, who helped, again, on\nthis audio feature, even finding current or not too old systems that use some of\nthe new / old audio servers (EsoundD) running in the wild, which I never\nexpected to see. And also for exposing some weak spots in the USB advanced\nlogic, and helping with the sbopkg and slpkg repo logic and tools reports.\n\n2. To the Manjaro forum users, for providing cases that show where inxi can be\nimproved. The audio server/api issue, the current USB 3/4 upgrade, were\ninitiated by threads pointing to things that could be improved in inxi. So I\nguess the real thanks are for using inxi enough to trigger cases that show where\nit's weak or can be better. Note that this requires that I follow roughly their\nforums, however I only look at threads that seem like they might be of general\ninterest, or which suggest a possible weak spot in inxi, and I don't follow them\nconsistently. More reliable is to file github issues, since I will always see\nthose.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKNOWN ISSUES:\n\n1. DesktopData: at one point, BunsenLabs Debian OpenBox had XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP\nset to XFCE, which it isn't, but inxi can't work around such hacks, plus I don't\neven know if Bunsen is around anymore anyway.\n\n2. DesktopData: CODE 1 reminds us that the time to depend on x tools like xprop\nfor anything re desktop/wm detections is fast drawing to a close, true Wayland\nwill not have xprop, unless it's running on xwayland, which is not something\nthat should be relied on. Maybe recheck Moksha/Enlightenment which depend on\nxprop for version detection.\n\nThe list of xprop detected wm/desktops in get_env_xprop_misc_data() is almost\nall X only wm/desktops, so those should be safe unless one of them decides to\nwork on a wayland comositor.\n\n3. BSD: ongoing weaknesses in BSD data sources make maintaining feature parity\nimpossible, but I am trying to get the BSD data as clean and consistent as\npossible. I wish this were not the case, but the fact is, /sys is expanding and\ncreating excellent and reliable data sources with every major Linux kernel\nupdate, and so far nothing comparable has appeared in the BSDs. This is just\nreality, it's not a condemnation, but something like the /proc then /sys file\nsystems are an excellent idea, well worth emulating.\n\n4. For the RAM available/total clarification, there's a slight issue because\nfree/meminfo show MemAvailable as Free for use RAM, but dmesg shows available\nmeaning what was available to the system during boot, minus the reserved\npercentage. Since we needed one term, available to System offers the closest\nin terms of technical precision without being too verbose. Technically available\nin this context means: total physical minus 'kernel code' minus 'reserved'.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBUGS:\n\n1. CheckRecommends: See Fix 6b, more or less a bug, but really just a fix.\n\n2. AUDIO: for USB devices, put extra data into row 0, no matter which row the\nUSB device is. This led to the extra data for USB being assigned to the wrong\nrow. Sigh.\n\n3. OptionsHandler: When show{'ram'} was set, for bsd, set use{'bsd-raid'}, which\nmakes both show raid and ram fail for BSD. Oops. User mode RAM data only seen in\nOpenBSD so far. This made loading $dboot{'ram'} fail, and any raid as well,\nsigh, unless -m was also tripped.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFIXES:\n\n1. DistroData: typo for Arch base: was ctios, was supposed to be ctlos.\n\n2a. DesktopData: found case where xprop -root not present (Void Linux), so xfce\ntest failed. Split to new function dedicated to xfce detection that doesn't use\nxprop data. Also, XFCE is working on their Wayland version, which would in\ntheory not even have xprop by default.\n\nAlso, the base version number test for xfce depended on xprop, but\nxprop doesn't even have that xfce version data anymore, so just checking if\nxfce(4|5|)-panel exist and assigning primary version based on that test.\n\n2b. DesktopData: Also see See CODE 1a,1b for further xprop and test fixes that\ncould have led to false positive or negative test conditions for the items that\nused xprop tests. These tests are all xprop agnostic now, if it's there, they\nwill use it, if not, do the best they can.\n\n3. PackageData: fixed legacy dpkg-query, old version did not support -f shortcut\nfor --showformat. This made dpkg package listing fail.\n\n4a. GRAPHICS: Added legacy XFree86.0.log to X log path detection, that was an\noversight. Also added legacy module syntax _drv.o (not _drv.so). This gets X\ndriver data now for very old systems.\n\n4b. GRAPHICS: fixed corner case where no x driver data, running as root, was not\nsupposed to show 'note: X driver n/a' message, that was a holdover from before\ndriver output was cleaned up and driver: N/A shows when no drivers at all found.\nJust forgot to remove it when doing recent updates in the driver section, maybe?\n\n5. REPOS/PackageData: For netpkg Zenwalk Slackware systems, showed only slackpkg\nrepo data, empty, and showed the Slackware pm, not netpkg for pm. See\nEnhancements 5, 6.\n\n6. REPOS: removed slapt_get file /etc/slapt-get/pubring.kbx, that's not a repo\nfile. Thanks chrisreturn for pointing that out.\n\n7a. CheckRecommends: See also CODE 6. Fixed case where > 1 package manager is\ndetected on system, now lists them one by one for detected, and shows package\ninstall options as well. Before only picked first detected, which could lead\nto wrong results for Missing Package lists.\n\n7b. CheckRecommends: Fixed glitch, forgot to update the current shell/version\nwhen ShellData was refactored, this led to no current shell + version showing\nup in recommends core tools report.\n\n8. RAM: fixed speed_mapper string match to allow for older syntaxes. This is as\nfar as known OpenBSD only, from dboot data. Matches then converts PC2700 to\nPC-2700 which then allows for mapping.\n\n9. RAM/PROCESSES/INFO/SHORT: Finally tracked down a long time oddity, where for\nexample:\n RAM: total: 31.28 GiB\ndoes not match 32 GiB physical installed. This is because that is the total\navailable after kernel and system reserved RAM is deducted, and in some cases,\nGPU allocated RAM. There are also corner cases where the listed amount can be\nless due to physical RAM damage, but that's uncommon.\n\nAdded explanation of why it's different, and what available is referring to in\nman -m/--memory.\n\nChanged -m, -tm to show:\n\nSystem RAM: available: 31.28 GiB used 26.23 GiB (83.9%)\n\nand -I to show:\n\nMemory: available: 31.28 GiB used 26.23 GiB (83.9%)\n\nYou can get the 'reserved' and 'kernel code' data from dmesg, but since Debian\nmade that root/sudo tool, can't count on being able to parse that out of dmesg,\nplus you can never count no dmesg anyway since it can get overwritten by kernel\noops or wonky device etc. inxi doesn't use dmesg data for Linux for this reason.\n\n... [    0.000000] Memory: 32784756K/33435864K available (10252K kernel code,\n1243K rwdata, 3324K rodata, 1584K init, 2280K bss, 651108K reserved, 0K\ncma-reserved)\n\nAlso removed Raspberry Pi video RAM added back in to total now that it's clear\nit's what is available. This may also make systems with GPU using system RAM\nmore correct.\n\n9. SENSORS: sensors /sys tried to create concatenated string with $unit $value\nbut these are not necessarily defined, that needed to be protected with defined\ntests.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nENHANCEMENTS:\n\n1a. AUDIO: JACK: added helper nsmd (new session manager), and its recommended\ngui agordejo. That's the drop in replacement for non-session-manager, the dev of\nwhich apparently lost interest in that project. But the ID method will work fine\nfor for either, since both ran as nsmd.\n\n1b. AUDIO: PULSE: added pulseaudio-alsa plugin support for helpers. This is like\npipewire-alsa plugin, just alsa config file. Only seen in Arch Linux so far, but\nif others use similar paths for the glob pattern, they will also work fine.\n\nAlso added pulseaudio-esound-compat plugin, which is easier to detect with\n/usr/bin/esdcompat.\n\nAlso added paman, pulseaudio manager.\n\n1c. AUDIO: ESOUND,ARTS: added legacy esd (EsounD aka: Enlightened Sound Daemon)\nand aRts sound server support, with basic help/tools. These are quite old, but\nare still occasionally seen in the wild on newer systems, surprisingly enough.\n\n1d. AUDIO: ALSA: added alsactl to alsa tools. Missed that one, it's an /sbin\ntype utility.\n\n1e. AUDIO: ALSA: First try at ALSA compiled in but inactive report,  previously\ndepended on active only state of the API. Now uses compiled in SND_ kernel\nswitch using the /boot/config-[kernel] file, which is a big expensive parse but\nonly will activate on Linux kernels with no /proc/asound present. This fallback\nfails if kernel config file not present: /boot/config-$(uname -r).\n\n1f. AUDIO: OSS: added tool ossctl.\n\n1g. AUDIO: NAS: added helper: audiooss which is an OSS compat layer.\n\n2a. DistroData: added Arch base distros: ArchEX, Bridge Linux, Condres OS,\nFeliz, LiriOS, Magpie, Namib, Porteus, RevengeOS, SalientOS, VeltOS.\n\nNone of these are verified. Some don't exist anymore.\nSource: https://www.slant.co/topics/7603/~arch-linux-based-distributions\n\n2b. DistroData: added ubuntu lunar 23-4 release id.\n\n2c. DistroData: added porteux, added porteux, zenwalk to slackware systembase\n\n3. DesktopData/GRAPHICS: added Smithay Wayland compositor. Not verified.\n\n4a. UsbData/UsbItem: added USB lanes (-Jxx) and mode (-Ja), to add more useful\ndata about USB revision and mode names the USB group has created. Otherwise it's\ntoo difficult to try to explain it. Note that -Jxx lanes follows other inxi\nitems that show PCIe lanes as an -xx item to try to keep it consistent.\n\nThis also consolidates the bsd and linux data sources, see CODE 5.\n\nNote modes and lanes are Linux only because the revision number, lanes, and\nspeed used to determine mode are only natively available in Linux as actual\ninternal data values. If this changes BSD support will be added in the future.\n\nThe BSD rev and speed data is synthesized completely by inxi using some string\nvalues, and thus is not reliable, which means that pretending inxi can get this\ngranular with data that is not coming directly from the system itself is\nprobably not a good idea.\n\nFollowing wikipedia mode names: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB4\n\nThese are the known possible combinations:\nrev: 1.0 mode: 1.0 lanes: 1 speed: 1.5 Mbps\nrev: 1.1 mode: 1.0 lanes: 1 speed: 1.5 Mbps\nrev: 1.1 mode: 1.1 lanes: 1 speed: 12 Mbps\nrev: 2.0 mode: 1.0 lanes: 1 speed: 1.5 Mbps\nrev: 2.0 mode: 1.1 lanes: 1 speed: 12 Mbps\nrev: 2.0 mode: 2.0 lanes: 1 speed: 480 Mbps\nrev: 2.1 mode: 2.0 lanes: 1 speed: 480 Mbps\nrev: 3.0 mode: 3.2 gen-1x1 lanes: 1 speed:  5 Gbps\nrev: 3.0 mode: 3.2 gen-1x2 lanes: 2 speed: 10 Gbps\nrev: 3.1 mode: 3.2 gen-1x1 lanes: 1 speed:  5 Gbps\nrev: 3.1 mode: 3.2 gen-1x2 lanes: 2 speed: 10 Gbps\nrev: 3.1 mode: 3.2 gen-2x2 lanes: 2 speed: 20 Gbps [seen this case]\nrev: 3.2 mode: 3.2 gen-1x1 lanes: 1 speed:  5 Gbps [wrong rev: seen this case]\nrev: 3.2 mode: 3.2 gen-1x2 lanes: 2 speed: 10 Gbps [wrong rev: possible case]\nrev: 3.2 mode: 3.2 gen-2x1 lanes: 1 speed: 10 Gbps\nrev: 3.2 mode: 3.2 gen-2x2 lanes: 2 speed: 20 Gbps\nrev: 3.2 mode: 4-v1 gen-3x2 lanes: 2 speed: 40 Gbps [not seen, but possible]\nrev: 4 mode: 4-v1 gen-2x1 lanes; 1 speed: 10 Gbps\nrev: 4 mode: 4-v1 gen-2x2 lanes: 2 speed: 20 Gbps\nrev: 4 mode: 4-v1 gen-3x1 lanes: 1 speed: 20 Gbps\nrev: 4 mode: 4-v2 gen-3x2 lanes: 2 speed: 40 Gbps\nrev: 4 mode: 4-v2 gen-4x1 lanes: 1 speed: 40 Gbps\nrev: 4 mode: 4-v2 gen-4x2 lanes: 2 speed: 80 Gbps\nrev: 4 mode: 4-v2 gen-4x3-asymmetric lanes: 3 up, 1 down speed:120 Gbps\n\nI believe 120Gbps takes the 2 lanes of tx/rx and converts 2 rx lanes to tx so\nthe entire lane is dedicated to transmit. and the third lane is dedicated to rx.\n\nIncludes error message for unknown usb 3/4 rev/speed match combos. These can be\nbad hardware self reporting or unknown other issues.\n\n4b. USB: Added Si/IEC speeds (base 2, base 10). -Ja triggers extra IEC, base 2\nBytes (xxx [MG]iB/s). -Jx triggers basic standard Si xxx [MG]b/s base 10 bits.\n\n5a. PackageData: added netpkg as package tool. This stores data in same location\nas slackpkg, but assume if exists directory /var/netpkg, then the system is\nusing netpkg as pm, not slackpkg.\n\n5b. PackageData: added Slackware sbopkg, sboui as tools for pkgtool and netpkg.\n\n6a. REPOS: added netpkg (Zenwalk Slackware based pm) repo report.\n\n6b. REPOS: added sbopkg basic repo report. This handles both value syntax types,\nas well as the ability of /root config file to overwrite /etc config repo.\n\n6c. REPOS: added slpkg repo report. This handles their old and newer syntax.\n\n7a. CheckRecommends: For Slackware users, added pkgtool missing package name,\nalso will use netpkg so hopefully Zenwalk uses same package names.\n\n7b. CheckRecommends: Added radeon to kernel modules checks.\n\n8. AUDIO/BLUETOOTH/DRIVES/GRAPHICS/NETWORK: For USB, -[ADEGN]xx adds rev, speed,\nlanes. -[ADEGN]a adds mode.\n\n9. RAM: Updated RAM PC DDR in speed_mapper(), which is as far as I know only\nused by OpenBSD, which allows for MT/s speeds as non-root user, which is nice.\nThat list hadn't been updated in a long time, so filled out DDR 1-5 PCx-yyyy\nids.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCHANGES:\n\n1a. USB: For -Jxy1, speed is now a child of rev: parent. This goes along with\nmode: and lanes: being children of rev:. This follows how USB consortium wants\nto refer to USB revisions now: by speed, lanes, and modes, the latter being the\ntechnical term, the speed being the marketing term.\n\n1b. USB: If no speed data found, show N/A. This should almost never happen\nexcept for very old Linux and rarely with BSD.\n\n1c. USB: Device type is lower cased except for abbreviations (type-C, HID). This\nmakes it more consistent as a value.\n\n1d. USB: Show basic Si speed with -Jx, and adds new IEC speed with -Ja.\n\n2. CheckRecommends: See ENHANCEMENT, CODE 6. Now showing row by row package\nmanagers and missing packages, by package manager(s).\n\n3. DRIVES: Changed long standing redundant use of 'type':\ntype: USB ... type: HDD\nto:\ntype: USB ... tech: HDD\n'tech:' means the technology used, HDD, SDD, and if we can ever figure out how\nto detect it, Hybrid Hard Drive (HHD),\n\n4. AUDIO/BLUETOOTH/DRIVES/GRAPHIC/NETWORK: moved 'type: USB' pair to after\ndriver for -A/-E/-G/-N, which allows it to be the parent of the new USB data\nblock. Negative is it moves it a bit further back in the line.\n\nFor Drives, it moves it from after /dev.. maj-min to after block-size, However,\nwith -D/-Dx, it's last in the line, which is nice. This is the only way I could\nfind to make it more consistent across all possible USB device/drive type\nreports.\n\n5. INFO/RAM/PROCESSES: Changed -I:\n\nMemory: [total] used:\nto:\nMemory: available: [total] used:\n\nChanged -tm/-m to be consistent:\n\nMemory: RAM: total: .. used..\nto:\nMemory: System RAM: available: ... used:..\n\nThis corrects a long standing inaccuracy where MemTotal is not actually the full\nsystem RAM, but is the RAM minus reserved stuff for system and kernel, and GPU\nmemory in some cases.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDOCUMENTATION:\n\n1a. DOCS: docs/inxi-audio.txt: ongoing updates, adding more information, more\non helpers, detection methods, etc.\n\n1b. DOCS: New: docs/inxi-usb.txt: USB info, update, added more, a work in\nprogress.\n\n1c. DOCS: docs/inxi-custom-recommends.txt: name in inxi comment did not match,\nand updated to new comment cleaned up syntax in example. Fixed inxi comment file\nname.\n\n1d. DOCS: New: docs/inxi-unit-handling.txt: To document how inxi handles\nsize/speed data internally, and ideally, to help integrate all those methods\ninto one big tool one day, not spread across many area.\n\n1e. DOCS: New: docs/inxi-repo-package-manager.txt: To start to document arcana\nand methods and commands and outputs for package managers. Since this is a late\nstart, will take time to complete, but better late than never.\n\n2a. MAN/OPTIONS: updated for USB -Jx, -Jxx, -Ja, adding lanes, mode, iec speed\nitems.\n\n2b. MAN/OPTIONS: fixed error which had USB speed as -Jxxx instead of -Jxx. Also\nthen changed speed to be -Jx.\n\n2c. MAN/OPTIONS: updated for repos for SBOPKG, SBOUI, SLPKG, and added\nSLAPT_GET, I'd forgotten that one.\n\n2d. MAN/OPTIONS: updated for -xx[ADEGN] USB rev, speed, lanes; for -a[ADEGN]\nupdated for USB mode.\n\n2e. MAN/OPTIONS: updated for memory available/used changed.\n\n3. MAN: fixed some inconsistent use of short/long form display in extra data\noptions.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCODE:\n\n1a. DesktopData: New function for xfce only detections, turns out xprop is not\nnecessarily installed, Void Linux for example had failed ID. Old version\nrequired xprop to do the tests, which was not robust and failed in this case.\nFunction: get_env_xfce_data(). Also made xprop data optional for all the\nxxx_xprop_data desktop tests, not just some of them. This will forward proof\nthe desktops\n\n1b. DesktopData: Fixed bad parens in test cases, was not correctly organized.\nif (a || b || (c || d) && e)\nwas supposed to be:\nif (a || b || ((c || d) && e))\nOdd how those types of glitches creep in, one fix is also to just make the lines\nbreak more reasonably so the conditions are easier to parse visually.\n\n2a. DEBUGGER: Added /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 xorg conf file to debugger.\n\n2b. DEBUGGER: audio_data(): added audio server versions to cover all known ones.\n\n3. MemoryData: changed all $memory to array references, got rid of split :\nseparators, which were clearly legacy items leftover from bash/gawk days. Also\nchanged MemoryData::get('splits') to get('full') to reflect this change.\n\nThis change should be transparent though it may introduce corner case undefined\nvalue situation but that should not happen since array values are defined first.\n\n4. UsbData: Refactor of usb speed, rev, added lanes, mode. Refactored most of\nthe bsd/linux rev/speed logic, merged some of bsd speed/rev into the new\nversion_data() function, which loads all the data based on what is calling it.\nThis helps consolidate the logic across usb data sources.\n\n5a. GLOBAL: made functions/methods use same comment syntax for args:\n args: 0:...; 1:...\nalways starting with 0, to match array index. Same syntax for return array index\nvalues. In some cases simply note a variable is passed by ref:\n args: $value passed by reference.\n\n5b. GLOBAL: made all sub/functions/methods follow the same spacing syntax. This\nseems to be a good compromise for space/readability. Note that adding in these\nnew lines added about 400 lines to the total length, plus the line breaks that\nwere already there. Yes, inxi has a lot of sub routines! aka functions and\nsometimes aka methods.\n\n[empty line]\n[comments]\nsub [name] {\n\nPackages/classes now also all follow the same spacing rules:\n\n[empty line]\n[comments]\n{\npackage [name];\n[empty line]\n[comments]\nsub [name] {\n...\n}\n}\n\nInternally, subs generally do not use any empty lines unless it makes sense to\ndo so for some specific reason.\n\n5c: GLOBAL: made start of sub comments be upper case, I have a bad habit of\ntyping comments in lower case, easier to read if it's reads like a normal\nsentence.\n\n6. CheckRecommends: refactored entire items logic, set global hash for test\nitems. Made support > 1 detected package manager.\n\n7. REPOS: cleaned up comments for package manager/repo blocks.\n\n8. SENSORS: sensors_sys failed to reset to undefined $unit and $value, and also\nfailed to test if they were defined before using them in concatenation.",

      "message": "Significant upgrade to sound server running detections, much more granular and\nhopefully more accurate, with more useful reporting values. Also added some nice\nuseful audio api/server tool and info items.\n\nPackagers: this corrects possibly wrong or misleading audio server reports,\nparticularly related to PulseAudio/PipeWire, which can lead to support issues\nand lack of clarity due to ambiguous or wrong reports about sound Servers\npresent, active, or off. Upgrading your package is highly recommended.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSPECIAL THANKS:\n\n1. Thanks to people like Chimera dev Daniel \"q66\" Kolesa for experimenting with\nnon systemd (uses dinit/dinitctl), non GCC, non GNU linux, and for making early\npre-alpha versions run in vm, and for being easy to test!\n\nNot so much because I personally want or care about or view as a positive\nskipping GNU tools or GCC in favor of clang and BSD tools, but more because\nthese experiments help make the general overall Linux ecosystem more robust.\nIncluding inxi.\n\n2. Thanks for the Manjaro people for noting this issue on their forums.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKNOWN ISSUES:\n\n1a. AUDIO: jack_control and pw-cli won't run as root, exit with error. This\nforces back to fallback process present tests for active running state.\n\n1b. AUDIO: pactl will start pipewire/pipewire-pulse/pulseaudio if stopped and\nnot masked, so not using since that would make inxi alter the state of the\nsystem.\n\n1c. AUDIO: pipewire-alsa, pulseaudio-jack depend on file exist globs, tested on\nArch Linux, Debian base, but unknown if paths exist on other Linux pimary\ndistros. Easy to add to globbing tests, but no going to check them all!\n\n2. SERVICES: systemctl status [service] can fail if service loaded using --user\nwhich is a new one on me, not sure how to handle that.\n\n3. It would be nice to get inxi issues like the sound server/api glitches\nhandled by filing an issue on inxi github, and not to rely on my seeing a random\ndistro forum post, which I only found by pure coincidence.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBUGS:\n\n1. AUDIO: See Fixes 3a,b,c. In some cases false report of pulseaudio and\npipewire running: yes create unclear output and results, or misleading. Thanks\nto manjaro users to noticing this and mentioning it in a forum post.\n\nNote: it's much more effective to file issues on inxi github than to hope I will\nsee a random forum post one day.\n\n2. DEBUGGER: Bug in debugger, somewhere introduced '-- list' (instead of\n'--list') for bluetoothctl which made older systems hang when running the\ndebugger. No idea when or how that space got introduced.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFIXES:\n\n1. INFO: Compilers showed Compilers: gcc: N/A when clang/gcc not installed, this\nwas not intended, but was a small glitch in main::get_gcc_data(), where it\nassigned undef as array contents when gcc not defined. This was exposed by\nChimera, which uses clang, but would have happened any time gcc not installed on\nsystem.\n\n2. SYSTEM: tiny fix, was getting ',' at end of kernel compiler version.\n\n3a. AUDIO: For pipewire, made process detection test more robust, now excludes\npipewire-pulse in case where that might be running without pipewire on/enabled.\n\n3b. AUDIO: bigger fix, more robust tests for audio servers running for jack,\npipewire, pulseaudio, these look for more explicit server tool reports. Certain\nnot to be reliable always, and fail for superuser, will probably need more\ntweaking. Also notes for jack, pulse, pipewire if only positive detection found\nvia ps aux: active (process) to avoid incorrect data, and root specific messages\ndepending on situation.\n\n3c. AUDIO: was testing for pactl to determine if pulseaudio installed, but found\ncase where pactl could be installed without pulseaudio. Now tests for pulseaudio\ninstalled.\n\n3d. AUDIO: weak fix for Linux OSS4 version, using /etc/oss4/version.dat file,\nwhich may or may not exist on all distros.\n\n3e. AUDIO: alsa-oss compat can create /dev/sndstat file, which would then lead\nto positive OSS detection even if it's not present. This is corrected, and will\nnot show if asound/version exists and no ossinfo. For linux, relying on ossinfo\npresence, which comes from oss4-base.\n\n3f. AUDIO: Older ALSA /proc/asound/version had a date string in parentheses\nafter the Driver Version, so now explicitly get the string after Version.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nENHANCEMENTS:\n\n1. REPOS: added support for /etc/apk/repositories.d/*.list, which works pretty\nmuch the same as /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list. This is to make Chimera apk\nrepos show up, previously only supported /etc/apk/repositories file read.\n\n2a. DistroData: Added Feren to distro system base. This was much trickier than\nit should be due to inconsistent use of os-release field names, but that's how\nit goes.\n\n2b. DistroData: new Arch derived distro XeroLinux added to system base. I know,\nI know, it's a never-ending endeavor (get it?) since these pop up all the time,\nbut might as well add them now and then as they appear.\n\n3a. AUDIO: inxi now handles pipewire-pulse as top layer audio daemon, along with\nseveral other server/api helpers. Note that pw-jack does not appear to be a\ndaemon, just a plugin, so shows 'plugin'. Extra sound server helpers added when\ndiscovered or requested.\n\n  API: ALSA\n    v: k5.19.0-16.2-liquorix-amd64\n    status: kernel-api\n  Server-1: PulseAudio\n    v: 16.1\n    status: off (on pipewire-pulse)\n  Server-2: PipeWire\n    v: 0.3.65\n    status: active\n    with:\n      1: pipewire-pulse\n        status: active\n      2: pw-jack\n        type: plugin\n\n3b. AUDIO: For -Aa, added tools: report. Currently supports these basic tools:\n\nalsa: alsamixer alsamixergui amixer\njack: cadence jack_control jack_mixer qjackctl\noss: dsbmixer mixer ossinfo ossmix ossxmix vmixctl\nnas: auctl auinfo\npipewire: pw-cat pw-cli wpctl) [+pactl if pipewire-pulse and no pulseaudio\npulse: pacat pactl pamix pamixer pavucontrol pulsemixer\nroar: roarcat roarctl\nsndiod: aucat midicat mixerctl sndioctl\n\nNote that inxi-perl/docs/inxi-audio.txt has lists of alternates or rejected\nhelpers and tools, but we want to keep that output short and sane.\n\n3c. AUDIO: For BSDs, if sndiod is detected, adds an API line for sndio. Note\nthis may create 2 API lines for FreeBSD using OSS.\n\n3d. AUDIO: Added basic support for roar sound server, NAS (Network Audio\nSystem).\n\n4. CPU: new Intel and AMD cpu model matches for latest and future, Luna Lake,\nZen 4c.\n\n5. GRAPHICS: new nvidia current, AMD, and Intel GPU ids.\n\n6. DRIVES: more disk vendors, ids! The list never stops, but sadly, so many are\nnot identifiable. Check: inxi-perl/tools/lists/disks_unhandled to see if you\ncan positively identify any of those.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCHANGES:\n\n1a. AUDIO: Changed main API/Server running: to status: [status], that syntax is\nmore able to handle different circumstances.\n\n1b. AUDIO: With change to status:, now uses granular fixes above, and adds root\nnotes if no active detections.\n\n1c. AUDIO: Changed 'Sound API', 'Sound Server' to 'API', 'Server'. This avoids\nambiguity with some types, it's the Audio section, and those are the APIs and\nServers for that Audio section. Makes it match Graphics as well. and is shorter.\n\n1d. AUDIO: Changed 'Sound Interface' for sndiod to 'Server', which is how it's\nlisted, and for BSD, added API: sndio item. Also changed 'sndio' to 'sndiod' for\nthe Server: item.\n\n1e. AUDIO: Changed ALSA/BSD sndio to show: status: api since saying an api\nis running makes little sense, it's there or it's not there. OSS can be enabled\nor disabled so shows status: active/off for Linux, but kernel-api for BSDs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDOCUMENTATION:\n\n1a. MAN: Added note for helpers item: with: pipewire-pulse/pw-jack etc to -Axx.\n\n1b. MAN: Added -Aa item for audio server tools.\n\n2. OPTIONS: Updated for -Axx helpers, -Aa tools.\n\n3. DOCS: Created inxi-perl/docs/inxi-audio.txt doc file. Too many odd factoids\nto forget about during this upgrade!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCODE:\n\n1. REPOS: Moved %keys to %repo_keys and set it only once with set_repo_keys(),\nthose big hash assigns per iteration are really expensive, now stores it\nglobally in RepoItem and sets only once.\n\n2. INFO: main::get_gcc_data() failed to handle case where there is no gcc at all\ninstalled, resulted in returning an array with content of 'undef', not an empty\narray as intended. This made the array not set test fail for Compilers, so gcc\nshowed as N/A, which was not intended.\n\n3. DistroData: changed internal lsb/osr $distro to $distro_lsb/$distro_osr,\nwhich lets inxi update the distro name during system base processing in cases\nwhere the data is redundant. Stupid hack, sigh, should not be necessary, but\nthat's life, /etc/os-release was poorly designed so it leads to such confusions.\n\n4a. AUDIO: Added --dbg 52 to output results of pw-cli.\n\n4b. AUDIO: refactored sound_data, renamed, added {jack,pipewire,pulse}_status(),\nsound_helpers(), sound_tools() utilities.\n\n5. DEBUGGER: added more pactl and pw-cli outputs, and pipewire-pulse,\npipewire-jack --version.\n\n6. main::get_driver_modules(): add space after ',' if total string > 40\ncharacters to allow splitting very long unbroken strings of modules that\notherwise would not break as expected.",

      "message": "A small point release, various smaller items, ongoing updates to matching table\nfeatures, bug fixes, but nothing major.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSPECIAL THANKS:\n\n1. Thanks Umio-Yasuno in github issue #281 for actually being proactive and\nfinding some Intel/AMD gpu device id lists. I wish more issues would be like\nthat.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKNOWN ISSUES:\n\n1. DEBUG: --debug-arg and --debug-arg-use must use the full format:\n--debug-arg=\"-GS\", or else the command line eats the args, even if in quotes.\nThe error handlers will then complain about no data supplied, and it will exit.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBUGS:\n\n1. GRAPHICS: An accidental 'and' instead of 'or' test (see Code 1) led to\nsystems without gpu or dri graphics drivers not showing their xorg driver even\nwhen present. This was due to a mistake, and also due to how Perl handles || and\n&& in sequence, which made this bug not show up until I tested on a system with\nxorg graphics driver, but without dri or gpu drivers. Virtually no modern\nhardware or operating systems would trip this condition, but older hardware and\noperating systems, which may not have gpu or dri drivers, might. And did, in my\ncase. This is by the way why I try to test on old hardware at least now and\nthen.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFIXES:\n\n1. CODE: A poorly done attempt at optimization would have broken case\ninsensitive pre-compiled regex with $pattern = qr/../ because you can't add\n/$pattern/i to precompiled pattern, but qr/.../i support only added perl 5.014.\nThis should impact almost nobody, but it is/was a glitch. Basically qr/../ can\nonly be used when no /i type modifier is required if supporting Perl less than\n5.014.\n\nSee inxi-perl/docs/optimization.txt section REGEX for more on this.\n\nNote that Perl already compares the values in the variable each iteration via a\nsimple equality test, so the only real gain from using qr// is not having to do\nthat equality test each iteration of a loop.\n\n2. OUTPUT: Fixed a few small inner key name failures to use '-' instead of ' '\nto separate key terms:\n\n3. REPOS: Called urpm urpmq, which is the query tool, not the actual type.\n\n4. GRAPHICS: Fixed some gpu_id.pl matching rules. Thanks Umio-Yasuno in github\nissue #281 for noticing that some of the matching rules were either wrong or not\nloose enough.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nENHANCEMENTS:\n\n1a. OPTIONS: Long time oversight, no option to test or do one time change of key:\nvalue separator string ':'. This goes along with existing config option\nSEP2_CONSOLE. Added --separator/--sep {character}.\n\n1b. OPTIONS: Added synonym for --output: --export, and for --output-file:\n--export-file.\n\n2a. GRAPHICS: New Intel gpu data source, from intel, finally. This let us add a\nlot more gpu ids. Thanks Umio-Yasuno in github issue #281 for finding these.\n\n2b. GRAPHICS: New AMD data source, from github. This let me fill in some more,\nalbeit not as accurately as previous sources, but added more so fine. Thanks\nUmio-Yasuno in github issue #281 for finding these.\n\n3. CONFIG: In a first, took a feature from acxi, --config, and imported it into\ninxi! This shows active current configuration, by file.\n\n4. CPU: updated, fine tuned amd cpu microarch ids.\n\n5. DISKS: More disk vendors added. Not as many as usual, I think the high tech\nsanctions against China may be slowing the rate of new Chinese SSD/USB vendors.\nBut still some new ones, as always. Not many new IDs for existing ones though,\nthat is noteworthy. A few new data sources to help pinpoint vendor names found\ntoo, though those won't in general impact users, but can be used to determine if\na string is in fact a company name.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCHANGES:\n\n1. OUTPUT: Fix 2, -t 'started by:' key name changed to: started-by:\n-G 'direct render:' changed to 'direct-render:'.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDOCUMENTATION:\n\n1a. MAN: there were a few <...> instead of [...] for required option arguments.\nFixed those.\n\n1b. MAN: also added --debug-id [string] since that is in general useful info.\n\n1c. MAN: Added qualifiers about when xwayland: and compositor: items appear for\ndefault -Ga output.\n\n1d. MAN: Typo in config path in man page, .conf/ should be .config/.\n\n1e. MAN: for --output json/xml, added pointer to doc page on smxi.org, people\nbeing unable to grasp the output is getting tiresome.\n\n1f. MAN: Added synonym for --output, --export.\n\n2a. SMXI.ORG DOCS: added --output json/xml documentation page:\nhttps://smxi.org/docs/inxi-json-xml-output.htm - this is also linked to from the\ngithub wiki page, though of course nobody is going to read it, as well as from\na few pages in smxi.org.\n\n2b. Updated inxi-man,options,changelog.htm files.\n\n3. CHANGELOG: Changed to use same format as acxi.changelog, leading topic id's\nin upper case, makes it easier to scan read and organize.\n\n4a. DOCS: docs/inxi-cpu.txt - cleaned up, re-arranged a bit, added cpuid data\nexplanation, and updated header on inxi-perl/data/cpu/microarch to better\nexplain the way amd does ext fam / ext model, which are not the same,\nbizarrrely, very confusing.\n\n4b. DOCS: New: docs/inxi-disks.txt. Split out from inxi-resources.txt, part of\nthe ongoing to documentation modularization, slowly splitting out sub topics\nfrom inxi-data.txt and inxi-resources.txt. Note this is in general only done\nwhen I'm working on that specific feature. But slowly, surely.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCODE:\n\n1. GRAPHICS: Test when no gpu drivers and no dri drivers but x drivers never\nshowed x driver. Was supposed to be all || for tests:\n\nif (@$gpu_drivers || $graphics{'dri-drivers'} && @$x_drivers){\n\nhttps://perldoc.perl.org/perlop. I believe this led to test 1 being false, test\n2 being false, and since that left tests 2 and 3 needing to be true for the &&\nlogical and to be true. Since only one of the two was true, the last bit was\nseen as false.\n\n2. GRAPHICS: Connected with 1, noticed that for some weird reason, I'd decided\nto assign the array ref for drivers like this:\n\n@$x_drivers = (a, b, c);\nwhen it was supposed to be:\n$x_drivers = [a,b,c];\n\nThis did not cause any issues, since they mean the same thing, but it was silly\nto write it that way.\n\n3a. DEBUG: Added --debug-arg-use which allows testers to run a specific argument\ncombination that may be causing issues.\n\n3b. DEBUG: Also added more validation, to make sure arg for --debug-arg /\n--debug-arg-use start with - or -- followed by a letter.\n\n4. START: Removed this code block from set_konvi_data. I had left this in place\nfor a release or two to make sure no need for it was found, but it will never be\nused since it never worked in the first place.\n\t# my $config_cmd = '';\n\t# there's no current kde 5 konvi config tool that we're aware of. Correct if changes.\n\t# This part may never have worked, but I don't have legacy data to determine.\n\t# The idea was to get inxi.conf files from konvi data stores, but that was never right.\n\t# if (main::check_program('kde4-config')){\n\t#\t$config_cmd = 'kde4-config --path data';\n\t# }\n\t# kde5-coinfig never existed, was replaced by $XDG_DATA_HOME in KDE\n\t# elsif (main::check_program('kde-config')){\n\t# \t$config_cmd = 'kde-config --path data';\n\t# }\n\t# elsif (main::check_program('qtpaths')){\n\t# \t$config_cmd = 'qtpaths --paths GenericDataLocation';\n\t# }\n\t# The section below is on request of Argonel from the Konversation developer team:\n\t# it sources config files like $HOME/.kde/share/apps/konversation/scripts/inxi.conf\n\t#  if ($config_cmd){\n\t#\t  my @data = main::grabber(\"$config_cmd 2>/dev/null\",':');\n\t# \tConfigs::set(\\@data) if @data;\n\t#\t main::log_data('dump',\"kde config \\@data\",\\@data) if $b_log;\n\t# }\n\n5. OPTIONS: in OptionsHandler::post_process(), reorganized the various run and\nexit triggers, help, configs, recommends, version, etc. All on top now.",

      "message": "A small point release, mainly to get some bug fixes, and a few minor issues, and\nsome ongoing updates to various matching rule features like CPU, Disk Vendors,\netc.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSPECIAL THANKS:\n\n1. mrmazda, for continuing to poke around and finding oddities on occasion.\n\n2. The various packagers, for continuing to package inxi.\n\n3. Nothing else really comes to mind, so I'm thankful that no real issues popped\nup, and the ongoing attempt to stabilize and clean up the several year\naggressive development cycle of code is proceeding quite well.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKNOWN ISSUES:\n\n1. I'm currently getting no data samples from new server type CPU systems,\nNvidia Grace, Ampere, both ARM V2 based. The ARM cpu arch logic hasn't been\nupdated in many years since I have gotten no meaningful data, currently\nRaspberry Pi 4 is the latest ARM generation I've seen data for, and no ARM\nserver type for many years. So support there is really not happening, and won't\nbe until I start getting real datasets on those server systems.\n\nNvidia uses Neoverse V2 ARM core, but I have no information on that yet. Also\nnothing from the Amazon CPU, new Marvell datacenter type CPUs. But that's not\nsurprising.Also, nothing from the N1 (2019) or V1 Neoverse (2021) ARM CPU family\neven though those have now been out a while.\n\nA lot of the advanced CPU data should 'just work' because of the huge CPU\nrefactor done recently, but some of the more advanced data, particularly\ncpu_arch type data, isn't going to be available until I get real data sets so I\ncan see what's going on. No idea how CPUID might work for ARM cpus, for example.\n\nObjectively many of these datacenter/machine learning focused CPUs will never\nsee a system inxi will run on, though most I suspect will be running GNU/Linux\nin some form, so inxi can in theory run on them, but those people all know what\ntheir systems are doing, so the need isn't particularly pressing of course.\n\nWith this said, I did used to have more access to cutting edge server stuff, but\nthat has largely dried up, particularly ARM based chips.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBUGS:\n\n1. Found while resolving Fix 2, it turns out > 1 X Screens would not have shown\ncorrectly due to failing to pass $j row counter by reference. This bug was\nintroduced when the big Monitor updates were done, since you almost never see\n> 1 X Screens now, I never saw it until testing something for another reason.\n\nThis led to > 1 Screen showing on the same line as the last monitor of the\nprevious Screen.\n\nSee also Fixes 2, 3, 4, and Code 1, 2, 3.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFIXES:\n\n1. Changed Intel Saphire Rapids release data from 2021+ (what Intel had\ninitially announced) to 2023+ (the actual release date). Not my fault!! They\nwere too optimistic, inxi merely repeated their claims.\n\n2. While trying to figure out extra Screen showing up, found a series of subtle\nissues with how X Screens are handled. Added in more robust test for if Screen\nID has been added by xdpyinfo_data, and other weird corner cases that might\ncause strange results in Display Screen-x.\n\nCreated check_screen() to allow for more granular and debugable testing.\n\nThis forum post helped focus attention on this issue:\n\nhttps://forum.endeavouros.com/t/\\\nmy-second-screen-is-not-working-after-installing-nvidia/33388\n\n3. %monitors was not correctly assigned in xrandr screen fallback.\n\n4. Set number of Screens found if no xdpyinfo or if xrandr found > xdpyinfo\nnumber of screens.\n\n5. Added Zhaoxin match to Centaur match, might show up on cpu string.\n\n6. OpenBSD's package manager was listed as pkg_info, but it's slightly more\naccurate to call it pkg_add. As far as I understand it, OpenBSD doesn't really\nhave a 'package manager' per se, it has a suite of tools to manage packages.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nENHANCEMENTS:\n\n1. Added some Zhaoxin/Centaur IDs, unlikely to show up, but you never know.\n\n2. Added m68k to X display driver list. This was just added to kernel as a full\ndrm driver! Very legacy, but has users in vm, qemu, etc.\n\n3. More disk vendors! I skipped updating this last time because, well,\ncollecting the data is really boring, and slightly tedious, and really serves to\nsimply remind that this is not the way towards a better world. Or are cheap SSDs\nthe true path after all? I doubt it, but you never know.\n\n4. New AMD, Nvidia gpu ids.\n\n5. New Intel Cpu Microarch IDs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCHANGES:\n\n1. No changes to speak of, so I won't.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDOCUMENTATION:\n\n1. Various ongoing updates to inxi-perl/docs. These are very slowly being pulled\ninto a more useful form. Emphasis on slowly.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCODE:\n\n1. In Graphics::xdpyinfo_data() and Graphics::xrandr_data() got rid of extra\nstep, now just assign hash reference directly to push anonymous hash reference\ninto array. Had used intermidiate variable assignement of hash ref, but that is\npointless.\n\n2. Added $fake{'xdpyinfo'}, hoping to get some debugger data to test weird\nextra 'Screen' seen with Endeavor user (see Fix 2, 3, Bug 1).\n\n3. Also, instead of using \\%monitors, which creates a reference to the last\nvalue of %monitors, used the correct and safer {%monitors}, which creates an\nanonymous reference of the value %monitors had at that moment. This is a subtle\nPerl error which is easy to make in cases where the hash or array reference is\nalmsot never > 1 instance, such as > 1 X Screens.\n\nThis should at least help resolve the repeated 'monitors' rows in the output\nin Fixes 2, 3, 4.\n\n4. Added 'source' to $graphics{'screens'} to log where each detected screen came\nfrom, xdpyinfo or xrandr.",

      "message": "This release fixes another very long standing bug, which I was not sure was an\ninxi or a Konversation bug, which made tracking it down very difficult. Special\nthanks to argonel of Konversation for helping solve this problem, or at least,\nfor directing my attention towards the likely cause area, and away from wrong\nideas. The bug was that inxi simply did not run in Konversation, it would exit\nwith error when run with /cmd or /inxi via symbolic links.\n\nThis may not seem like a huge deal to many of you, but the actual history of\ninxi was directly linked to user support in mainly Konversation, so this feature\nnot working I have alwyas found extremely annoying, but I could never figure out\nwhy it wasn't workiing, and didn't really know where to start until Argonel\nhelped narrow it down to a specific Konversation function in inxi. At which\npoint tracking down the real bug was fairly easy. Since testing in IRC is always\na key test point for inxi features and releases, not working in my main GUI IRC\nclient forced me to use CLI clients like irssi, via /exec -o inxi.\n\nThere was a secondary cause of failure, which was missing a key qdbus package,\nwhich made figuring this one out a two step process.\n\nSo inxi is once again working in all areas, with no known significant failure\nareas beyond known issues that have no current solution, or which I don't feel\nlike doing.\n\nBut possibly more important, a goal I have had for a while now of doing long\nneeded code refactors, bug fixes, without huge new code blocks or features\nadding new future fixes and bugs, has been slowly happening.\n\nThis was quite important, because inxi's codebase and logic is so complex and\nlarge now that at some point, it required rest and cleanup and corrections,\nwithout continuously adding new code and logic, which would then trigger new\nfixes and bugs. In other words, the code is taking a long needed, and well\ndeserved, breather, to recover after huge increases in the overall LOC and\nfeature sets.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKNOWN ISSUES:\n\n1. No known way to detect that the system might be Wayland for the Graphics:..\nAPI: fixes, unless Xwayland is installed if the wayland protocol detections\nfailed, which they often do in console. Not practical to look for all compositor\nvariants on system to determine if it could be Wayland if not X or Xvesa, so\nthat one will just be what it is, which is fine, definitely better than it was\nbefore. Note this is only an issue if in Console, no Display. Note that if inxi\nis run as root, Wayland data also usually fails, even in Display.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBUGS:\n\n1. Another corner case monitor position issue, applied fallback primary monitor\nrule when a primary monitor had already been located. This is corrected via a\ngraphics global $b_primary which once set will disable this fallback feature.\nObjectively, the fallback feature should just be removed. The test is if that\nmonitor is not primary, and if position is 0x0, then assume primary, without\nverifying no primary had been located yet.\n\n2. A super old bug, in current konversation, was failing to trip the konvi\ndetections, which then resulted in not stripping off the first two args in\n@ARGV, which then resulted in bad args being passed to inxi on konvi start,\nwhich then resulted in silent failing. Many thanks to argonel of #konversation\nfor the patience to help me figure out what was going on with this bug. He's\nbeen a Konversation developer probably longer than I've been doing inxi.\n\nCause was very tricky and subtle, the ps aux path for konvi had changed\nslightly, not the path, but the pattern, it used to be:\n\nkonversation -session [sessin id]\nbut it's changed to:\nkonversation -qwindowtitle Konversation\nor just plain:\nkonversation as line ending.\n\nThis led to failure to find konvi running, which then made the konvi ids fail.\n\nAlso, this would not work if the qdbus-qt5 package was not installed, or other\ndistros might have that packaged differently. Because of these dual causes, I\nwas simply unable to figure out what was going on for many years. I suspect this\nstopped working with KDE 5/QT 5, but I'm not sure.\n\n3. Used wrong key names for some ZFS tests and fallbacks, those could have led\nto failures though very difficult to test and verify this. Also see fix 5, which\nof course also looks like a bug, acts like one, but was actually due to a new\nuse of /dev/disk/by-partuuid for ZFS components in Ubuntu which inxi had not\nseen before.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFIXES:\n\n1. Alternate ps IDs for appimage detection (try appimagelauncher), alternate\npaths for possible appimage storage locations (also try ~/.appimage/*). File\nnames might be *.appimage or *.AppImage, probably other variants too.\n\n2. Going along with Change 1, made tests more granular for missing graphics API\ntype data. Also updated messages to be more correct and clear, in and out of\ndisplay. This corrects an issue I'd seen but never resolved, which was on\nheadless systems showing this message:\n\nMessage: GL data unavailable in console. Try -G --display\n\nNow the tests are far more granular, and only show that if glxinfo is installed,\nand also shows specific messages if glxinfo not installed, but X/Xorg present,\nor, for Wayland, if Xwayland present. These all get their own specific messages\nnow, and generally will also show which API is being used, or API: N/A if\nnothing is detected, as in the case of a headless system with no X, Wayland,\netc.\n\n3. Github issue #275 on of all things Microsoft WSL environment, has a small\nglitch with undefined display hz, but otherwise inxi seems to work in that\nenvironment, albeit missing many data types!\n\n4. Made tests for konversation more robust, including test for\n$ENV{'PYTHONPATH'} containing konversation in path, which I believe will work\nfor all new Konversations (KDE 5 and newer), and be much faster. The previous\ntests are now more robust and less prone to failure, and only activate when\nPYTHONPATH is not present with konversation string present as well.\n\n5. Fix for ZFS using /dev/disk/by-partuuid for partition id in zfs,\nwhich can lead to wrong usable disk total size report, along with failure\nto show components. Thanks delanym, issue #276 for reporting this problem, which\nalso exposed some harder to trigger bugs in ZFS (Bug 3).\n\n6. Exposed by issue #276, case where line was wrapping value when value was too\nshort visually to value: used: 34.4 GiB (4.5%) due to the 3 or more words\ntrigger to enable wrapping of value, but noticed that if length of line was\nexactly max-width, not > or <, it might vanish.\n\n7. Case where no X or GPU drivers found, but dri driver detected, was not\nshowing, now does.\n\n8. OpenRC is the init system in some cases, that is: readlink /sbin/init >\n/sbin/openrc-init, where /proc/1/comm == init. Was showing only as OpenRC rc\ntype, which wasn't actually correct.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nENHANCEMENTS:\n\n1. New nvidia gpu product ids for Turing, Ampere, Lovelace, Hopper. New Intel\nGPU ids.\n\n2. Added Zinc to systembase/distro, needs slightly special handling to get both\nnames right. Also added Tuxedo, which could use existing methods.\n\n3. Added dpkg tool nala, which is sort of a CLI front end for apt, zinc uses it,\nbut it's also in Debian main package pool. Also deb-get, which is another zinc\nthing for package management.\n\n4. Full support for dinit: version, dinitctl w/status in ServiceData\n\n4. Added initial support for init systems: 31init (31 line C program, no\n--version), Hummingbird (unknown if -v/--version).\n\n5. A few new CPU arch ids (new Intels).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCHANGES:\n\n1. Going somewhat along with the change in Audio to call ALSA a Sound API\ninstead of a sound server, changed key name OpenGL: to API: OpenGL in Graphics.\nAlso for EGL wayland, calling that the api too.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL\n\nThis conforms more closely to how these things are defined. Note that once\nagain, a value had been used as a key name, which almost always indicates a\nfailure to understand something about the core tech.\n\n2. Changed wrapping of values from 3 words or more to 3 or more words AND length\n> 24 characters. Saw example of:\n .... used: 28.45 GiB\n  (4.5%)\n\nwhich isn't desirable.\n\n3. Changed minimum wrap to 60 columns, the new wrapper features are working so\nwell that if users want output that short, it will usually work fine, except of\ncourse for very long word strings like a kernel name or parameter.\n\nNote that this does not truncate long 'words' that might be wrapped, or going\nalong with Change 2, long 'sentences' of 2 words, those will always appear on\nthe same line regardless. For 'sentences' of 3 or more words, however, it goes\nword by word, so it could well wrap after the first word, and so on. Obviously,\na 24 or fewer character value will never be wrapped, which was the intended\ncorrection of change 2.\n\n4. Going with Fix 8, OpenRc is an init system when it owns /proc/1/comm, had not\nrealized that /proc/1/comm == init can map to dinit, openrc as init. Now will\nonly show OpenRc as rc: type if not init as well.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDOCUMENTATION:\n\n1. Updates in man for Change 1.\n\n2. Added to docs/inxi-graphics.txt good quote re EGL/GBM, as well as VBE/GOP for\nvesa. Trying to find docs where they actually say clearly it's an API is\nremarkably difficult.\n\n3. Man page, added note about Konversation requiring qdbus-qt5 (Debian+),\nqt5-qttool (RHEL+/SUSE+), qt-tools (Arch+) for inxi to work inside it. Also\nupdated smxi.org/docs/inxi-usage.txt to note requirements for Konversation use\nand setup.\n\n4. Man, help, changed min width for -y/--width from 80 to 60.\n\n5. docs/inxi-values.txt updated for --cygwin, --wsl fake OS type switches. Not\ntechnically the OS, more the environment, but close enough.\n\n6. docs/inxi-init.txt updated for new init types.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCODE:\n\n1. Refactored tools/gpu_ids.pl to correct and enhance some features.\n\n2. Renamed functions and sections to better reflect that the display interface\nis an API, this makes stuff less odd internally, and makes the function/variable\nnames correspond better to what the stuff really is.\n\n3. Commented out kde konversation data source config collector, that logic looks\nlike it never worked, and couldn't work, since it never actually located\ninxi.conf files, just paths to the data directories.\n\n4. Expanded release.pl to handle acxi docs as well, makes it all consistent and\na lot easier to do long term.\n\n5. Fake --wsl WSL switch, not really used, but in case.\n\n6. Changed $b_cygwin to $windows{'cygwin'} and added $windows{'wsl'}.\n\n7. Added -WSL to debugger string generator once WSL type is detected.\n\n8. Refactored init, runlevel functions get_init_data() (now InitData::get()),\nget_runlevel_data() (now InitData::get_runlevel()), get_runlevel_default() (now\nInitData::get_runlevel_default()) into one package/class: InitData. This should\nhave been done a long time ago, to follow the general rule \"if > 1 functions for\na tool refactor it into a class/package\" for when to create a package/class\ninternally.\n\n9. Completed gpu_ids.pl, now outputs the full hash set per item, so entire\nblocks can be copied/pasted over. Something of a pain to get comments included,\nwhich aren't strictly necessary in pinxi itself, but they do help read the\nhashes for gpu data.",

      "message": "Another big one, with a long time to-do item done! /sys based sensors data is\nnow used as a fallback, with fully revised error messages to handle this new\nsensor data variant. Due to potential bugs this might create, this was left off\nof the 3.3.21 release, which needed to go out on a schedule, but there is plenty\nof time for 3.3.22 to be debugged.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKNOWN ISSUES:\n\n1. inxi can't currently handle raw in[0-9] voltage sensor data from\n/sys/class/hwmon, that may get corrected, but I've honestly never seen a system\nthat shows raw in[0-9] values as field names, so it's probably not very\npressing, but it can happen. Similar that is to how default fanx and tempx field\nnames are processed.\n\n2. Currently only checking -Gx, -Nx device temp for bus IDs ending in .0, which\nis the primary PCI device. I think that's the only one that will have a temp,\n.1, which is a second device on the same hardware, doesn't have that data in\ntests. Saves some requests since it's a big glob of /sys.\n\n3. Spiral Linux has no obvious way to determine that it is Spiral and not Debian\n11 as base distro. No /etc/ files for distro ID contain anything for spiral, so\nleaving that one alone.\n\n4. Can't get 100% reliable cpu level > v2 due to it not being a pure cpu flag\nbased test, which is kind of sadly typical for the originators of this idea, but\nsince the choice was dump the feature, or just use the note: check for > v2,\nopted for note: check. One wants to ask questions here, but honestly I already\nknow the answer so why bother asking the question... The docs for this are\nawful, inadequate, incomplete.\n\nMy strong suspicion is that this is NOT intended to be a distro-wide feature\nbeyond v2 support minimum, but rather is for specific compile options for a\npackage or daemon or server or whatever that can benefit from this type of\nfine-tuning. One thinks of Gentoo for example back when such fine-tunings could\nactually deliver noticeable differences in performance. A per system type\nfeature that is, not a distro-wide feature. At least that's my initial feeling,\nbut this is probably about all the  time I will spend on it since inxi can't get\nit more accurate anyway.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBUGS:\n\n1. Bug in monitor position logic, the horizontal/vertical sorts were being done\nalphanumerically, leading to absurd results where 800 > 2560 or whatever.\nBasically all x / y positions less than 1000 would have forced the smaller\nnumber to be considered as the greatest value. Another corner case find by\nmrmazda. Thanks mrmazda!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFIXES:\n\n1. Added i350bb sensor to network sensor type.\n\n2. Small glitch with some scenarios with missing fan1 in sensors, showed fan1 0\nrpm, but then showed fan 3: empty. That was a slight error in how undefined vs\n'' empty was treated.\n\n3. Added fix for defective fan speeds, skip fan item if > 15000, which is a bug\nin the fan speed report, making it useless. Seen 65535 reported RPM. Could\nprobably make it 10000 upper limit but suspect that is a simple bug that creates\nan absurd value, 2^16 so won't be anything high unless bug active. This fix runs\nfor ipmi, linux, and sysctl fan data.\n\n4. Trying for fix for dynamic gpu voltage, assumed always mV, but might be V.\n\n5. Inadequate or obscure or non-existent redhat/suse documentation led to some\nfixes for cpu v levels. Note that level v3/v4 can't be fully determined by cpu\nflag tests, but who cares? Certainly not me. Added 'note: check' for v3/v4.\n\n6. Nvidia device arch id was too loose, false id for non existing lovelace arch.\nNote that due to array reverse, the newest ids will always run first, which\nleads to possible false positives with first string match tests when no product\nIDs are available yet.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nENHANCEMENTS:\n\n1. Elbrus CPU arch, process, year, arch data made more complete using new data\nresource. Thanks Elbrus guys!\n\n2. Finally, raw, basic /sys/class/hwmon temp data. Linux kernel docs note\nsupports temp, fan, volts, amps, energy. But have only seen temps so far. Can\nforce /sys use with --force sensors-sys / --sensors-sys, though there's no point\nto doing that except to test.\n\nAlso changed --recommends to note lm-sensors not required for sensor data now.\n\n3. Adding device temp for -Gx, -Nx. Will only work for Linux and when found, and\nonly for free drivers (I think).\n\n4. Added xdriinfo based dri drivers (with fallback to Xorg.0.log as data source,\nnot as accurate), that will show if and only if that driver is not the same name\nas a detected X or gpu driver.\n\n5. Another big upgrade to cp_cpu_arch, added and corrected many AMD/Intel\nmatches.\n\n6. A few more gpu product ids, Intel, added.\n\n7. More disk vendors, ids, the list, as we are now well aware, is endless,\nreflecting perhaps the futility of pursuing the infinite using finite means.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCHANGES:\n\n1. Slight changes in how inxi supplies no sensor data messages, and in the\nfallback cases and handling. More accurate and precise, and more robust overall.\n\n2. Due to complexity of understanding level: and the fact not all cpu flags are\nexposed that are required, moved -Cxx level: to -Ca.\n\n3. Changing slightly inaccurate Sound Server for ALSA/OSS to Sound API, which is\nthe closest I can come to explaining clearly what it is. Note that you can only\nload one API type audio subsystem/driver, so you will be running one or the\nother, never both, from what I understand.\n\nSince OpenBSD sndio includes sndiod, calling that a sound server is basically\nfine, since it's both the server and the interface, if I understand it right,\nand there won't be a second sound server listed, actually won't be for any BSD\nthat I know of, it's going to be sndio or OSS or nothing, unless something has\nchanged.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDOCUMENTATION:\n\n1. Man page, updates for /sys/class/hwmon based sensor data.\n\n2. Small update for cpu level v3/v4, added note: check explanation, though it's\ntoo hard to really explain this stuff since the docs are... not wonderful, when\nthey even exist and don't contradict each other.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCODE:\n\n1. Refined significantly sensors missing data and error messages to be much more\naccurate and granular. Also enables more sensors tools, though hopefully they\nwon't appear since those are a real pain to implement, but it's more open to\nbeing sensor tool agnostic now due to these refinements than before.\n\n2. Added xdpiinfo to debugger.\n\n3. Switched x_drivers to return ref of array of refs, use join for output only,\nthat lets us use the drivers to test dri stuff also (if we want or need to), and\nkeeps it consistent with how most of inxi does that type of data\nhandling/testing. If undef, it means no array ref exists, which makes testing\neasy.\n\nNot truly understanding hash/array refs when inxi rewrite to Perl started is\nprobably one of the bigger causes of glitches and ongoing optimizations.\nBasically, in all but very small array cases, it's almost always better to start\nwith a ref from the start as soon as the hash/array moves between functions,\nwith one exception, when it's a globally stored data item. Then it depends. But\nthis requires a consistent testing for null data as well, which is harder if you\ndid it in different ways from the start. But slowly and surely chipping away at\nthese.",
