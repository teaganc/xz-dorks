      "message": "Bug#35889990: Setting secondary_engine to OFF causes offload issues with executing queries from stored procedures Bug#35988564: CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE failure after Table_ref::restore_properties\n\nThe problem is that when reaching the function RapidOptimize(),\nthe value of LEX::using_hypergraph_optimizer is not consistent with\nthe value of the session variable use_old_optimizer.\n\nThe problem is a missing setting of LEX::using_hypergraph_optimizer\nin the execution of a query. It was only synchronized with the\nhypergraph optimizer setting in preparation of a query, which is\nsufficient for regular statements which always perform both\npreparation and execution, but not for stored procedures that have\nseparate preparation and execution. The solution is to add this setting.\n\nBut this revealed another problem: sometimes execution is out of sync\nwith the current preparation. An optimization with the hypergraph\noptimizer requires that the preparation is also performed with\nsettings specific to the hypergraph optimizer. This may happen e.g if\nthe value of the session variable use_secondary_engine is switched from\n\"off\" or \"on\" to \"forced\" either between a preparation and execution\n(for prepared statements) or between two executions (for prepared\nstatements and stored procedure statements)\n\nThe solution to this is to track the current preparation state versus\nthe one desired (the optimizer switch setting). It is now checked\nthat the value of using_hypergraph_optimizer matches the current\noptimizer switch setting just after opening tables and before optimizing\nsuch statements, in which case we call ask_to_reprepare().\nDuring optimization we set using_hypergraph_optimizer according to the\noptimizer switch.\n\nThe test rapid.pfs_secondary has an increased reprepare count because we\nnow detect more often that an optimization requires a new preparation.\n\nIn addition, a test case was added to cover the problem described in\nbug#35988564.\n\nChange-Id: Ibf158576ec4cd1edde655d41f7c8bf2813e208ee",

      "message": "Bug#35913841: Queries from stored procedures not offloading to secondary engine when we have OUT arguments\n\nBefore this patch, RAPID could not handle queries of the type\nSELECT ... INTO <list of variables>. The reason for this was that these\nkind of queries were set up with a special Query_result interceptor\n(Query_dumpvar), whereas regular SELECT queries were set up with\nQuery_result_send, which was substituted on the RAPID side with a\nspecial protocol adapter. However, RAPID has also implemented another\nprotocol adapter (an Item wrapper), which is used for INSERT INTO\nand CREATE TABLE ... SELECT statements.\n\nIt was noted that this adapter could also be used for SELECT INTO,\nwhere the Item wrapper is used as an intermediary for Query_dumpvar.\n\nTwo new property functions on class Query_result are implemented:\nuse_protocol_adapter() returns true for Query_result_send and\nuse_protocol_wrapper() returns true for Query_dumpvar.\nAn alternative implementation may check these functions for when to use\nadapters resp. wrappers instead of the original Query result classes.\nThe function is_interceptor() is no longer used and is hence removed.\n\nWe identify this new requirement in IsSupportedProtocol(), where\nwe explicitly allow Query_dumpvar and Query_result_send query results,\nand in CreateQEP() where we create the Item wrapper for Query_dumpvar.\n\nNotice that this implements SELECT ... INTO both as regular statements,\nas prepared statements and as procedure statements.\n\nNotice also that the syntax variants SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE and\nSELECT ... INTO DUMPFILE are still not supported.\n\nMost of the changes are in the test suite where we have eliminated the\nearlier ER_SECONDARY_ENGINE_PLUGIN error code.\n\nA couple of test lines were removed from the tests rapid.sp and\nrapid.cp_sp because they gave different results in dict and varlen\nmodes.\n\nChange-Id: Icd56cb6fbc32e121a59599a7e5b7d651747804f5",

When this happens,\nwhile removing the redundant expressions from the\nquery block, if the select expression is an\nItem_ref object, on the first visit to this\nexpression, we mark the object as unlinked. On\nthe second visit, this time because of the\norder by, as the object is marked as unlinked,\nit exits the traversal without doing anything. However,\nwhen the item it refers to is visited, it does not\nknow that the item is still being referred to. So\nit ends up deleting the referenced item.\n\nSolution is to decrement the ref_count of\nan item without initiating the clean up\nof the underlying item unless its the last\nreference (This necessitated changes to\nall implementations of clean_up_after_removal).\nAlong with this we also remove m_unlinked member\nbecause it's no more needed. If the underlying\nitem of an Item_ref object is not abandoned, we\ndecrement the ref count and stop looking further.\n\nChange-Id: I4ef3aaf92a8c0961a541dae09c766929d93bb64e",

The corresponding call to\nlatch will unfix the above page provided m_n_recs is non-zero. This\nmeans that the first call to latch will not do anything.\n\nIn the first call to insert_direct, latch will do nothing, but release\nwill buffer fix the page. In the second call to insert_direct, the test\nwill simulate an error in the online log and force the DDL to error out.\nThis way the test checks the cleanup code in the DDL. In the bug, this\ncleanup had missed the latch, causing the page to remain buffer fixed -\nwhich was caught at shutdown.\n\nChange-Id: I70db8539c42bb4c1761b56cca5dadf814b2c5020",

      "message": "Bug #35449266 - An ALTER TABLE query corrupted the data dictionary so\nmysqld crashes\n\nBackground: Column names are case insensitive in MySQL. When \"ALTER\nTABLE .. ADD COLUMN .. ALGORITHM=INSTANT\" is triggered, the new row\nversion is created for this record. This version is stored on disk\nwith record and the column's metadata information is updated in\nstorage engine (se_private_data). And when \"ALTER TABLE .. CHANGE\nCOLUMN\" is triggered, we check if the column is renamed and the old\ncolumn's metadata is copied to new column.\n\nIssue: While checking if the column is renamed, we compare the name of\nthe column in the create table info with that of in the alter table\ninfo. But here the comparison is case sensitive which causes c1 to\ndiffer from C1. Thus returning a nullptr when get_renamed_col() is\ncalled, i.e., doesn't detect column rename and further leads to\nskipping the updation of physical position of newly renamed column.\nWhich is why it hits the assertion failure in debug build where a\nrenamed column should have the physical position updated already.\n\nFix: The solution is to compare the column names while ignoring the\ncase sensitivity.\n\nChange-Id: Ic30b183666da466a553cea45eb7028be3c2a36bb",

      "message": "Bug#33800633 startChangeNeighbour problem\n\nRevert of original patch.\n\nTesting with debug binaries has revealed problems with\nhitting several different assert related to handling of the\nTrpId queue mechanism.\n\nLikely cause is that get_trp() seems to deliver the\nsame TrpId to two different (assist_send-threads), one\nwhere the TrpId is delivered through the neighbour priority\nmechaninsm, and another where it is delivered as a non-neighbour.\n\nIf this happens it breaks the protection mechanisms if the\ntransporter buffers, where only a single threads is assumed to\noperate on the same TrpId.\n\nRoot cause may be that the patch now being reverted called\ninsert_trp() on transporters having data to sent as part of\nstartChangeNeighbourNode() - making it a non-neighbour\nTrpId awaiting sends.\n\nHowever, the later call to setNeighbourNode() may reinstantiate\nthe same NodeId as a neighbour again. Thus the same TrpId\ncoulde be returned both as a non-neighbour as a neighbour and\nbe operated upon on two different threads.\n\nChange-Id: Icada4600e008d551e97af2b31abd070f5e4ac68a",
