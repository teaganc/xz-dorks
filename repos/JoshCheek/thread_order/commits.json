      "message": "Fix bug where parent could resume without child being set\n\nThis is because the worker thread could call the enqueue block,\nwhich then creates the child thread, but if the scheduler is letting\nthe child go, then the worker may not resume to assign the child.\nThen, when the child wakes the parent, the scheduler may resume the parent\ninstead of the worker, thus the worker still has not assigned the child thread,\nand the parent is resumed.\n\nThis is not a problem in prob, b/c it's due to a refactoring I just made.\n\nThe solution is to have the child thread set the variable rather than the worker thread.",
