      "message": "Chez Scheme: reduce memory use of pbchunk conversion\n\nC code generated by the pbchunk conversion is especially verbose, with\nlong macro names for simple operations and lots of comments to reflect\nsource instructions. Generation of that code was formerly rendering to\ntext in memory, and then splitting into the output files, which turns\nout to use a lot of memory. Converting to text at the last minute can\nhave a much lower peak memory use.\n\nIf memory is at a premimum, then rendering to a temporary file would\nwork even better, but this change already brings memory use in line\nwith other build actions without having to deal with a temporary file.\nMemory use could also be reduced by dropping comments that connect to\nsource instructions; again, though, doesn't seem necessary for now.\n\nRelated to #4956",

      "message": "Chez Scheme: adjust `configure ZUO=<command>` support\n\nContinuing from 694fbd47a1, adjust the generated makefile so the\nsupplied `<command>` is not a makefile dependency. That way, `ZUO=zuo`\nworks if `zuo` is installed and the current build directory is not the\nsource directory. (The `zuo` executable is a dependency in a real and\nrelevant sense, but not in the sense of dependencies that we normally\ntrack in makefiles.)\n\nAlso adapt the makefile for the case that `ZUO=...` is not supplied\nand the build directory is not the source directory, in which case\n`ZUO_LIB_PATH` needs to be relative to the source directory.\n\nUsing `make ZUO=zuo` can also work, but in that case, `bin/zuo` is\nstill built as a dependency. It's possible that some portable makefile\nmagic could overcome that limitation, but it doesn't seem important.",
