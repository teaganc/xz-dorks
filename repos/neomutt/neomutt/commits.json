      "message": "Fix some mailbox prompts to use mailbox history ring\n\nCommit b0570d76, in the 2.0 release, improved some of the mailbox\nprompt flow and logic, creating a separate function for mailbox\nprompting.  At the same time it changed \"save/copy to mailbox\" to use\nthat function and thus the mailbox history ring.\n\nUnfortunately, this created a partition between some other prompts\nthat used the filename history ring but were actually prompting for\nmailboxes.\n\nChange those prompts: edit-fcc, and imap create/rename mailbox to use\nthe mailbox history ring.  This will allow values to be shared between\nthem and prompts such as \"open mailbox\" and \"save/copy to mailbox\".\n\nOrdinarily I wouldn't commit this to stable, but that change broke at\nleast one person's workflow badly.\n\nUpstream-commit: https://gitlab.com/muttmua/mutt/commit/bce2c294b27808f9373afa1ada61719f57d20e59",

      "message": "Fix scrolling when handling SIGWINCH in the index\n\nThe index had some (very very old) code which reset the scroll top\nduring SIGWINCH handling.  This caused a recomputation of the top,\nwhich caused the index to jumble around randomly during resizing.\n\nThe last few commits added SigWinch flag setting whenever\nmutt_endwin() was called, which meant this jumbling would occur much\nmore often.  (For example when piping a message.)\n\nAfter looking more closely, this top reset seems to be unnecessary.  A\nfull redraw needs to properly handle the case where \"current\" is\noutside the visible range, because a resize could occur in a called\nmenu.  Additionally, the menu.c code does just fine without this, and\nis used for all the other standard menus in Mutt.\n\nThanks to Vincent Lefèvre for helping test the SigWinch changes, and\nreporting this regression.\n\nUpstream-commit: https://gitlab.com/muttmua/mutt/commit/9cfa36ea4b388d91a8b9af181866ac8412ea4666",
