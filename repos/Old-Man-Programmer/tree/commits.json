(simonpmind)\n  - Fix issue where .info patterns relative to the .info file that did not use\n    a wildcard for matching the prefix were not matching files properly.\n    (German Lashevich)\n  - Added support for making trees from tab indented files (--fromtabfile)\n    (gitlab @AvidSeeker), also cleaned up some other issues in the fromfile\n    code.\n  - Fix buffer overflow in listdir() when file names are allowed to be longer\n    than 256 characters (like when using fromfile.) (Javier Jaramago Fernández)\n  - If when attempting to open a .gitignore or .info file from a top level\n    directory and failing, recursively check the parents for such a file.  This\n    stops when successful at opening such a file. This behavior might in the\n    future be modified to open all such files in all parents to until root is\n    reached. (Damien Bezborodov) Note that this requires the use of realpath()\n    which I think may be an issue for some OSes.\n  - Fix issue where tree would never descend (-l) a symbolic link when a full\n    tree is gathered (--du/matchdirs/prune) (gitlab @6ramr)",

      "message": "Version 2.1.0 (12/26/2022)\n  This is a bit bigger release, due to not realizing that gitlab/github was\n  not sending me email and ice+tree@mama.indstate.edu was broken.  This has\n  been fixed and I think I have gone through most all of the outstanding issues\n  that were submitted over the last few months.  Note to those that are sending\n  me git merge requests: because I distribute this in multiple ways and places,\n  and I tend to manually go over patches and often re-work them in any event, I\n  will not likely ever directly accept any merge requests. I will still use the\n  patch information from them for inclusion into the code, so you are more than\n  welcome to still submit such merges.\n  - Add support for --info and --gitignore for the --fromfile option.\n    (Suggested by Piotr Andruszkow)\n  - Add options --infofile and --gitfile to load .info and .gitignore files\n    explicitly.  Each implies --info or --gitignore respectively.\n  - Add NULL guard for json_printinfo() and xml_printinfo() (and fix ftype\n    printing for XML) (Kenta Arai)\n  - Fix getcharset() to not return a getenv() pointer (fix for ENV34-C issue.)\n    (Kenta Arai)\n  - Another attempt at fixing extraneous /'s in HTML URLs/output. (Sebastian\n    Rose)\n  - Fixed XML output (Dave Rice)\n  - Remove the (very outdated) French version of the manpage.  Look to\n    localization projects such as Debian's 'manpages-l10n' for localized\n    translations. (hmartink)\n  - Add support for the NO_COLOR environment variable (https://no-color.org/).\n    Equivalent to the -n option (can be still be overridden with -C).\n    (Timm Fitschen)\n  - Removed many C99isms to enable compiling on C90 compilers with fewer\n    warnings.  (Sith Wijesinghe and Matthew Sessions)  It should not be\n    necessary to avoid using a standard that is old enough to drink,\n    furthermore it is all but impossible to remove the remaining warnings and\n    have modern features like compound literals. In the meantime I've added\n    -std=c11 to the default CFLAGS for Linux and will likely not worry about\n    C90 compatibility going forward unless there is some other reason for it.\n  - Added a helper function for long command line arguments to clean up option\n    processing (and fixes the processing for a few of the options such as\n    --timefmt= (наб?).)\n  - Added --hintro and --houtro options to select files to use as the HTML\n    intro and outro.  Use /dev/null or an empty file to eliminate them\n    entirely.  This should make it much easier to create your own custom CSS\n    or embed one or more trees into a web page.\n  - Defer printing the version until the character set is known so we can use\n    the linedraw copyright symbol.\n  - Revert change to the error code to not return an error (code 2) when\n    attempting to list a non-directory that actually exists.  Tree will still\n    return an error when attempting to list a non-existing directory/file.\n  - Added option --fflinks which will process symbolic link information from\n    a file generated with 'tree -if --noreport' when using --fromfile.\n    (Suggested by Chentao Credungtao)\n  - Updated the totals reporting code to also include in the total the file or\n    directory that is being listed.  This should make a correct report when\n    doing something like 'tree *'.",

These issues were the result of forgetting that patmatch()\n      was just to match filenames to patterns, not paths.\n    - Patterns starting with / are actually relative to the .gitignore file,\n      not the root of the filesystem, go figure.\n    - Patterns without /'s in .gitignore apply to any file in any directory\n      under the .gitignore, not just the .gitignore directory\n  - Remove \"All rights reserved\" from copyright statements.  A left-over from\n    trees original artistic license.\n  - Add in --du and --prune to --help output (Nxueyamao?)\n  - Fixed segfault when an unknown directory is given with -X\n  - Fixed output up for -X and -J options.\n  - Remove one reference to strnlen which isn't necessary since it may not\n    be available on some OS's.",

Going forward the stddata option will only work\n    if the environment variable STDDATA_FD is present or set to the descriptor\n    to produce the JSON output on.\n  - Fix HTML url output issue. (Maxim Cournoyer)  It was definitely broken in\n    the 2.0.0 release, and this should normalize it with respect to older\n    versions, however I think it needs to be updated to work better.\n  - Update MANPATH for OS X (Michiel Beijen)\n  - Fixed an error with * in the patchmatch code where *foo*bar would match\n    *foo alone.

      "message": "Version 2.0.0 (12/21/2021)\n  - This started out as a 1.9.0 release but then I got fed up with the\n    abundance of directory listers (8 in total, 2 each for each output mode).\n    Nothing is terribly well tested since there are a lot of changes and I would\n    like to get this out the door finally, please report breakage.  This reduced\n    so much code that all the below additions only resulted in a code base that\n    is only 54 lines larger than 1.8.0.\n  - Rolled all the directory listers into 2 functions that call output specific\n    functions (removes one TODO).\n  - -R option now recursively calls the emit_tree() function rather than using\n    system() to re-call tree.  Also removes a TODO.\n  - Adds --info to print information about files/directories from information\n    found in .info files (removes a maybe do) In HTML output, comments show as\n    mouse over tooltips, which I imagine will be the most useful use of this\n    \"feature\".\n  - Output un-indented JSON on file descriptor 3 (\"stddata\") automatically if\n    file descriptor 3 is present (currently Linux only.) Maybe switch to BSON.\n  - Always HTML escape filenames in HTML output even when -C is used.\n    (Eric Pruitt)\n  - Return a non-zero exit status if there is a failure to open any directory.\n  - Added --gitignore option to filter out files specified by .gitignore files.\n    (also reads $GIT_DIR/info/exclude if present.) To facilitate gitignore,\n    adds support for ** on pattern matching to allow /**/ to match a single /.\n    This is not well tested and kind of hacked together, so may not work\n    correctly. (Jake Zimmerman and others)\n  - Now also supports multiple -I and -P instances. (Michiel Beijen and others)\n  - Now prints meta data for the top level directory as well.\n  - Split spaghetti code in main into individual functions.\n  - Properly sort --fromfile input (Chentao Credungtao via Debian)\n  - Make tree colorization use reset (rs code in dir_colors,) not normal color\n    when resetting attributes (Filips Romāns via Debian).\n  - Honor -n (no color) even if the CLICOLOR_FORCE environment variable is set\n    (Paul Seyfert)\n  - Added --metafirst to print the metadata before the indentation lines\n    (suggested by Richard Mitchell)\n  - Fix --sort option to not require =\n  - Defer sorting for --du until the entire sub-directory tree has been\n    processed.\n  - Optimized makefile, HP/UX support (Osipov, Michael). Note that this changes\n    the prefix default to /usr/local, which is becoming required for many\n    systems now.\n  - Renamed (the by now very obsolete) doc/tree.1.fr to doc/tree.fr.1 (Jonas\n    Stein)\n  - Fix JSON string escaping such that it is not using the HTML escaping (Fox\n    & others)\n  - Add --filesfirst option (John A. Fedoruk). Cleaned up sorting code to make\n    --dirsfirst and --filesfirst top level meta-sorts.\n  - \"arial\" not \"ariel\" (Mark), HTML style-sheet cleaned up in any event.\n  - Deprecate using local -DLINUX / -DCYGWIN and use the OS provided\n    __linux__ or __CYGWIN__ (Jonas Stein)\n  - XML/HTML/JSON output needs to be mutually exclusive, last command line\n    switch wins. (Sergei Maximov)\n  - Make sure we use xmalloc instead of malloc in a number of places (Tomáš\n    Beránek)",

Does not override -N or -q.\n  - Control characters are no longer printed in carrot notation, but as\n    backslashed octal, ala ls, except for codes 7-13 which are printed as\n    \\a, \\b, \\t, \\n, \\v, \\f and \\r respectively. Spaces and backslashes are\n    also now backslashed as per ls, for better input to scripts unless -Q\n    is in use (where \"'s are backslashed.) (Ujjwal Kumar)\n  - Added -U for unsorted listings (directory order).\n  - Added -c for sorting by last status change (ala ls -c).\n  - --dirsfirst is now a meta-sort and does not override -c, -v, -r or -t, but\n    is disabled by -U.\n  - After many requests, added the ability to process the entire tree before\n    emitting output.  Used for the new options --du, which works like the du\n    command: sums the amount of space under each directory and prints a total\n    amount used in the report and the --prune option which will prune all empty\n    directories from the output (makes the -P option output much more readable.)\n    It should be noted that this will be slow to output when processing large\n    directory trees and can consume copious amounts of memory, use at your own\n    peril.\n  - Added -X option to emit the directory tree in XML format (turns colorization\n    off always.)\n  - Added --timefmt option to specify the format of time display (implies -D).\n    Uses the strftime format.",
